My name is T.J. Telan. I am a software engineer based in Seattle. This blog is where I host my writing. Occasionally I'll submit to other platforms but I'll always repost here.

I work on at [Infinyon](https://www.infinyon.com/) on [Fluvio](https://www.fluvio.io/). On my free time I hack on [Orbital CI](https://github.com/orbitalci/orbital).

I write about:

* Being productive with new technology 
* Explanation of complex software systems
* Automation
* Programming languages
* Security
* Open Source software
