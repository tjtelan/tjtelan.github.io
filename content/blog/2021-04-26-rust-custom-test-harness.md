## Let’s talk about integration testing in Rust

I ran into a problem effectively using `cargo test` in [Fluvio](https://github.com/infinyon/fluvio) for integration testing. But I learned that you aren’t stuck with the functionality of `cargo test`.

In this post, we’ll go implementing a custom test harness and some of the decision making that led me to this type of solution.


### How does cargo test work by default?

There is a distinction between unit tests and integration tests in [the Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html). The distinction is less about testing strategy and more about defining Rust’s conventions for test organization.

The main points are that:
  * Your tests are annotated with `#[test]`
  * [libtest](https://github.com/rust-lang/libtest) harness enumerates through all of your tests (a point we’ll revisit later in more detail)
  * libtest returns the pass/fail status of the execution


### What do I need from integration testing?

There isn’t anything libtest specifically offers to support integration testing patterns.

Setup of a standard test environment, especially in a complex system, is essential for managing expected behavior when making code changes.

Libtest does not assist with setup or teardown. I need the ability to abstract away the setup and teardown of my test environment from test code. 

This task will be performed either way. Without harness support, setup/teardown will be performed via external shell scripts or padding the setup/teardown process within every single integration test...

It isn’t convenient to manage setup and teardown in a different context than the integration test. This kind of testing overhead leads to hard to reproduce and time consuming mistakes.

### Where do we get started with a custom test harness?

We’re going to build all our integration tests into a single crate. This is recommended in order to speed up compile time ([[1](https://endler.dev/2020/rust-compile-times/#combine-all-integration-tests-in-a-single-binary)], [[2](https://matklad.github.io/2021/02/27/delete-cargo-integration-tests.html)])

This is distinctive, because libtest will compile each of your `#[test]` labeled functions into its own binary crate (with its own `main()`) and executes it as part of the test. 

First we’re going to create an integration test directory at the root of the crate where we’re going to build our integration test focused binary.

```shell
$ mkdir integration
$ touch integration/main.rs

# Then create a main() function in main.rs
```

In your Cargo.toml, you want to add 

```toml
# Cargo.toml

[dev-dependencies]
inventory = "0.1"

[[test]]
name = “integration”
path = “integration/main.rs”
harness = false
```

What this does is tell cargo test to not use libtest when running the `integration` test.

Then when we run `cargo test integration`, what cargo will do is compile `integration/main.rs` and execute it in the same manner as `cargo run`. This is all a harness is from `cargo`’s perspective. 

(We'll revisit the `inventory` crate later in the post)


### Add Setup and teardown steps

First thing we’ll do is lay the foundation for our testing pattern. We’ll create 2 functions, `setup()` and `teardown()`, and add them to our `main()` (with reserved space inbetween for our future tests to be called).

```rust
// main.rs

fn setup() {
   println!("Setup")
}

fn teardown() {
   println!("Teardown")
}
fn main() {
   // Setup test environment
   setup();

   // TODO: Run the test

   // Teardown test environment
   teardown();
}
```

### Collect all integration tests

What do I mean? Just use `#[test]`, right? That’s what I was thinking at least. Turns out that is you opt out of using `#[test]` with `harness = false`. 


#### How does libtest collect tests?

After digging around in the [libtest](https://github.com/rust-lang/libtest/blob/master/libtest/lib.rs) and [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/src/cargo/ops/cargo_test.rs) and [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_builtin_macros/src/test.rs) code, the short answer is: it isn’t clear and it isn't reusable.

If that surprises you, then you were like me. I was hoping to use the test collection functionality from `#[test]`, but it wasn’t clear how to accomplish this. My mental model for how `cargo test` works needed a refresh.

This gives you 2 practical options for collecting tests

1. Manually modify `integration/main.rs` and add your test in between the setup and teardown
    * A quick and straightforward solution if you have a small set of tests
2. Build a test collector. We generate an external test catalog, and modify `integration/main.rs` to execute tests from the catalog.
    * This is a long term solution, which we’ll be covering for the rest of the post.

### Building the test collector

The [inventory](https://crates.io/crates/inventory) crate markets itself as a plugin registry system. It will be doing all the heavy lifting. In this case, our tests are the plugins. 

In our `main.rs`, let’s declare a new module `tests`, where we can organize all the integration tests.


```diff
// main.rs

+ pub mod tests;

fn setup() {
   println!("Setup")
}

fn teardown() {
   println!("Teardown")
}
fn main() {
   // Setup test environment
   setup();

   // TODO: Run the test

   // Teardown test environment
   teardown();
}
```

In our new module, we’ll start by creating a struct to represent a single test for the plugin registry.

```rust
// tests/mod.rs

#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct IntegrationTest {
   pub name: &'static str,
   pub test_fn: fn(),
}

inventory::collect!(IntegrationTest);
```

Our struct `IntegrationTest` has 2 fields. 

*   `name` is a human-readable name, which can be used as a key for test selection.
*   `test_fn` is a pointer to a function whose signature is non-async, takes no args, and does not return anything.

I did not have simple success with using `async` function signatures, but you can use functions that take args, and return things.

ex. 

```rust
pub test_fn: fn(String) -> Result<(), ()>,
```

Then we call the `inventory::collect!()`macro to instantiate a plugin registry. When we write our tests, we’ll add to the plugin registry. More on this next.


### Adding new tests to plugin registry

We’re going to add a new basic test to the plugin registry. Start by adding a new submodule called `basic` in the tests module. 

```rust
// tests/mod.rs

pub mod basic;
```

In the `basic` module, we write our basic test `basic_test()`


```rust
// tests/basic.rs

use super::IntegrationTest;

fn basic_test() {
   println!("Running basic test")
}

inventory::submit!(IntegrationTest {
   name: "basic",
   test_fn: basic_test
});
```

We use `inventory::submit!()` to register our new test with the `IntegrationTest` struct we defined earlier.

`name` is a friendly, human-readable name. We can use this name as a key to search through the plugin registry.

`test_fn` takes the name of our test function. It has the same function signature as we defined. 


### Running tests from registry

We’ll finish this example up by running all of our registered tests

```diff
// main.rs

pub mod tests;
+ use tests::IntegrationTest;

fn setup() {
   println!("Setup")
}

fn teardown() {
   println!("Teardown")
}
fn main() {
   setup();

-   // TODO: Run the test
+   // Run the tests
+   for t in inventory::iter::<IntegrationTest> {
+       (t.test_fn)()
+   }

   teardown();
}
```

```shell
$ cargo test integration
   Compiling blog-post-example v0.1.0 (/home/telant/Documents/blog-post-example)
	Finished test [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.21s
 	Running target/debug/deps/blog_post_example-e042d787684bb333

running 0 tests

test result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

 	Running target/debug/deps/integration-7ed2452642c6f3b6

Setup
Running basic test
Teardown
```

### Tips for extending the example

The example runs all of the registered tests. But here are some useful impls if you want to extend even further. For example, adding a CLI, if you want to select individual tests. Or provide options to customize setup or teardown behavior.

```rust
impl IntegrationTest {
   pub fn all_test_names() -> Vec<&'static str> {
       inventory::iter::<IntegrationTest>
           .into_iter()
           .map(|x| x.name)
           .collect::<Vec<&str>>()
   }

   pub fn from_name<S: AsRef<str>>(test_name: S) -> Option<&'static IntegrationTest> {
       inventory::iter::<IntegrationTest>
           .into_iter()
           .find(|t| t.name == test_name.as_ref())
   }
}
```

If you want to see more of these ideas extended even further for a complex system, check out [Fluvio’s integration test runner](https://github.com/infinyon/fluvio/tree/master/tests/runner/src). We use a CLI and async functions, and an attribute procedural macro to cut down on some of the boilerplate.

### Conclusion

Rust’s testing ecosystem in the 2018 edition is great for unit testing. But for integration testing it still has room for improvement. Custom harnesses will become more necessary as Rust gains new developers. 

If we want to avoid reinventing the wheel, we need stable support from [libtest](https://docs.rs/libtest/0.0.1/libtest/) or more examples of how to perform test collection and patterns for setup, test, teardown workflows.

If you made it this far, thank you! I wish I had a guide like this before setting out on this development journey. Hopefully others find my experience helpful.
