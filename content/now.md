I recently joined [Infinyon](https://www.infinyon.com/) to work on [Fluvio](https://www.fluvio.io/), a data-streaming platform written in Rust.

My focus is on process improvements and performance type testing. It is giving me a lot of opportunity to learn more about Rust.

I have plans on venture out into making video educational content in the next quarter or so. Hopefully more on that subject soon.
