    <p>When I was a teenager, in the 00â€™s, the internet gave me net-positive energy and optimism. It was still very novel, and there was a lot of opportunity to discover niche communities that overlapped with my interests. I felt like part of an in-crowd and it deeply influenced my life.</p>
<p>I have continuously been connected online (Metaphorically. Bc I grew up with dial-up). Much of the novelty has long worn off.</p>
<h2 id="it-s-been-an-exhausting-year">Itâ€™s been an exhausting year<a class="zola-anchor" href="#it-s-been-an-exhausting-year" aria-label="Anchor link for: it-s-been-an-exhausting-year">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>I was laid off early in the year due to the pandemic. Due to the sudden loss of human interaction, I have been revisiting some of that yearning for connection as I transition to starting a business from scratch (more about that some other time). As a necessity, I am dependent on the internet for the majority of my human interaction. Maybe this is me being mentally old, but I feel the current energy of my echochamber to be more net-negative and Iâ€™m hoping I can introduce myself to people who build others up. </p>
<p>Niche communities are difficult for me to discover with the same ease as when I was young. Thatâ€™s not a reason enough for me to stop looking! So thatâ€™s fine. Iâ€™ll start looking where Iâ€™m at. For professional reasons, I <em>need</em> to start in Tech. So Iâ€™ll need to be more specific, because Tech is HUGE.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll spare you the rest of the thought exercise. Iâ€™ve been focusing my efforts within the Rust community. Why? Itâ€™s reignited my joy in writing code again, and Iâ€™m trying to start my business with it. <a rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-loved">And because people love it!</a> </p>
<p>With a few years under my belt, Iâ€™ve finally reached a point in my Rust development that I no longer consider myself a beginner and I can be productive. Great! Well, now what?</p>
<h3 id="what-have-i-been-doing">What have I been doing?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#what-have-i-been-doing" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-have-i-been-doing">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Regularly posting blog posts with a purpose of educating or sharing an experience as a non-expert</li>
<li>Hanging out around Tech Twitter and occasionally commenting and retweeting</li>
<li>Streaming writing Rust code for a few hours at least once a week</li>
<li>Joining so many Slack/Discord/Matrix/Gitter/IRC communities. Mostly lurking, but participating occasionally</li>
<li>Maintaining a <a rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://crates.io/crates/git-url-parse">Rust crate</a> and occasionally asking related projects if they would like to depend on it</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-have-i-been-expecting">What have I been expecting?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#what-have-i-been-expecting" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-have-i-been-expecting">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<p>Part of me was hoping eventually after seeing the same same faces, same namesâ€¦ that I would feel like I had joined the community and Iâ€™d stop feeling so intimidated. Perhaps that I would have experienced some subtle mutual acknowledgement of acquaintance? (I have since been lowering my expectations, fwiw. I now believe it is my responsibility to initiate the interactions with potential personal meaning or expectation.)</p>
<h3 id="what-have-i-not-been-doing">What have I not been doing?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#what-have-i-not-been-doing" aria-label="Anchor link for: what-have-i-not-been-doing">ðŸ”—</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Actively inviting conversation</li>
<li>Stepping out of my comfort zone to ask for feedback</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="won-t-you-be-my-neighbor">Wonâ€™t you be my neighbor?<a class="zola-anchor" href="#won-t-you-be-my-neighbor" aria-label="Anchor link for: won-t-you-be-my-neighbor">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>When was the last time you joined a new community? What was the defining moment when you felt like you belonged?</p>
<p>I donâ€™t feel unwelcome in Tech, but I feel invisible. My attempts to extend my reach out to those who might actually care to connect has random-like results. Not for lack of trying. But admittedly, I am placing too much value in establishing consistency before figuring out what works for me.</p>
<p>I don't know what options to try next. Iâ€™m not fishing for pity, but I am looking for advice. How do I find my audience? How can my audience find me?</p>
