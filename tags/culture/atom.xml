		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was a teenager, in the 00â€™s, the internet gave me net-positive energy and optimism. It was still very novel, and there was a lot of opportunity to discover niche communities that overlapped with my interests. I felt like part of an in-crowd and it deeply influenced my life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have continuously been connected online (Metaphorically. Bc I grew up with dial-up). Much of the novelty has long worn off.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-s-been-an-exhausting-year&quot;&gt;Itâ€™s been an exhausting year&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#it-s-been-an-exhausting-year&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: it-s-been-an-exhausting-year&quot;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was laid off early in the year due to the pandemic. Due to the sudden loss of human interaction, I have been revisiting some of that yearning for connection as I transition to starting a business from scratch (more about that some other time). As a necessity, I am dependent on the internet for the majority of my human interaction. Maybe this is me being mentally old, but I feel the current energy of my echochamber to be more net-negative and Iâ€™m hoping I can introduce myself to people who build others up. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niche communities are difficult for me to discover with the same ease as when I was young. Thatâ€™s not a reason enough for me to stop looking! So thatâ€™s fine. Iâ€™ll start looking where Iâ€™m at. For professional reasons, I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to start in Tech. So Iâ€™ll need to be more specific, because Tech is HUGE.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;searching-for-my-k-nearest-neighbors&quot;&gt;Searching for my k-nearest neighbors&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#searching-for-my-k-nearest-neighbors&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: searching-for-my-k-nearest-neighbors&quot;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™ll spare you the rest of the thought exercise. Iâ€™ve been focusing my efforts within the Rust community. Why? Itâ€™s reignited my joy in writing code again, and Iâ€™m trying to start my business with it. &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;insights.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;survey&#x2F;2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-loved&quot;&gt;And because people love it!&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a few years under my belt, Iâ€™ve finally reached a point in my Rust development that I no longer consider myself a beginner and I can be productive. Great! Well, now what?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-have-i-been-doing&quot;&gt;What have I been doing?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-have-i-been-doing&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-have-i-been-doing&quot;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regularly posting blog posts with a purpose of educating or sharing an experience as a non-expert&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hanging out around Tech Twitter and occasionally commenting and retweeting&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streaming writing Rust code for a few hours at least once a week&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joining so many Slack&#x2F;Discord&#x2F;Matrix&#x2F;Gitter&#x2F;IRC communities. Mostly lurking, but participating occasionally&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintaining a &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;git-url-parse&quot;&gt;Rust crate&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and occasionally asking related projects if they would like to depend on it&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-have-i-been-expecting&quot;&gt;What have I been expecting?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-have-i-been-expecting&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-have-i-been-expecting&quot;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of me was hoping eventually after seeing the same same faces, same namesâ€¦ that I would feel like I had joined the community and Iâ€™d stop feeling so intimidated. Perhaps that I would have experienced some subtle mutual acknowledgement of acquaintance? (I have since been lowering my expectations, fwiw. I now believe it is my responsibility to initiate the interactions with potential personal meaning or expectation.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-have-i-not-been-doing&quot;&gt;What have I not been doing?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-have-i-not-been-doing&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-have-i-not-been-doing&quot;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actively inviting conversation&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stepping out of my comfort zone to ask for feedback&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;won-t-you-be-my-neighbor&quot;&gt;Wonâ€™t you be my neighbor?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#won-t-you-be-my-neighbor&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: won-t-you-be-my-neighbor&quot;&gt;ðŸ”—&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When was the last time you joined a new community? What was the defining moment when you felt like you belonged?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I donâ€™t feel unwelcome in Tech, but I feel invisible. My attempts to extend my reach out to those who might actually care to connect has random-like results. Not for lack of trying. But admittedly, I am placing too much value in establishing consistency before figuring out what works for me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t know what options to try next. Iâ€™m not fishing for pity, but I am looking for advice. How do I find my audience? How can my audience find me?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
