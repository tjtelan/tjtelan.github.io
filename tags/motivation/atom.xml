		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post is in response to &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stephaniemorillo.co&#x2F;post&#x2F;reading-more-technical-content-can-help-you-improve-your-content-creation-skills-here-s-how&quot;&gt;Stephanie Morillo‚Äôs post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main piece of advice that is elaborated upon is to &lt;strong&gt;read a lot of technical content&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I think is very helpful about this post are the questions that are asked. I thought it would be a good idea to answer these questions so that I can share my opinions around how I read through technical content.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-i-like-a-piece-of-technical-content&quot;&gt;Why do I like a piece of technical content?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-do-i-like-a-piece-of-technical-content&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-do-i-like-a-piece-of-technical-content&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can answer this in different ways depending on the context that leads me to find technical content. The main two contexts being discovered through social media, or via a search engine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;through-social-media&quot;&gt;Through social media&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#through-social-media&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: through-social-media&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time on technical social media, like Reddit, Hacker News, Dev.to, and Twitter and I mostly only read the trending posts. So in these cases, an individual‚Äôs or company‚Äôs personality drives my interest over the actual content.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the time this leads to some cult of personality for popular posts in the comment section. This can‚Äôt be helped. However, this kind of engagement occasionally leads to interesting and tangential discussion. I like when the author can participate in the discussion as well, but this is a rare occurrence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer concepts over code in the case of social media discovery. Emphasis when I‚Äôm reading through something that is about an ecosystem I don‚Äôt have experience using. I like having my hand held lightly, and guided through the examples with metaphor or images.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus points if you both provide links for more context, as well as provide a simplified summary. Help frame how I should think, and even give negative examples for how I should not think if it helps.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These posts are primarily to entertain me, and then to inform me. I want the attention to readability with layout and markup to be more considered. If there are images to help set tone, I‚Äôd rather they be well used memes, or diagrams.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;through-search&quot;&gt;Through search&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#through-search&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: through-search&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I‚Äôm searching for something technical, it‚Äôs more likely that I‚Äôm doing research, design or implementation. So personality may continue to play a role in my likelihood to revisit an article, but the code snippets and coherence of an explanation is more important.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus points if consideration was made for keyword searching or organized textbook-like. I don‚Äôt need my hand held as much in his case. Just point me in a direction. I don‚Äôt want the entire post to be read through carefully unless the post is about low-level detail.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll be grumpy, but I will endure a post that is harder to skim if the content is promising enough.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-is-their-intended-audience&quot;&gt;Who is their intended audience?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#who-is-their-intended-audience&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: who-is-their-intended-audience&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of reading a lot of technical content means reading things that are not specifically targeted at myself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the content involves discussion of code, I really prefer a lot of gentle, but explicit nudging around the skill level required to make sense of what is in the post.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wide audience is generally my least favorite because content has to be high-level enough to not lose anyone. If you‚Äôre aiming wide, then say so or be very obvious. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Textbook-style is good enough for me. Build up concepts in a reasonable sequence. Or link to posts or definitions that talk about foundational concepts that you‚Äôre introducing. Unless you‚Äôve already stated an expected skill level, I will feel like you don‚Äôt know the audience you‚Äôre writing to.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-this-company-individual-do-really-well&quot;&gt;What does this (company&#x2F;individual) do really well?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-does-this-company-individual-do-really-well&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-does-this-company-individual-do-really-well&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of question is mostly for judging a collection of posts. Any single post may have left positive impressions on me of being informative, concise, funny, easy to read. But I don‚Äôt feel like I can judge what the competencies or patterns of a company or individual is until I see other work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look for consistency in voice. Are we having a conversation. Am I reading a monologue? Do you know where your content beats and break things up with whitespace or images? Are you flexible enough with how you present ideas so that I understand you or know what homework I have in order to understand? Visual branding also comes into mind when discussing consistency. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-this-content-help-me-do&quot;&gt;What does this content help me do?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-does-this-content-help-me-do&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-does-this-content-help-me-do&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My expectations of what the content offers me is again, dependent on the context in which I was introduced.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, if it is through social media, I‚Äôm looking first to have some kind of entertainment aspect. I‚Äôm looking for a breadth of information that allows me to insert my own ideas. I know that content creators aren‚Äôt always in control of where and when their content is posted, so this isn‚Äôt always going to be fair to judge entertainment value when the content is informational. But it is a plus if the author can be engaging and educational because it takes effort to do well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, if it is through organic search, I‚Äôm looking for some kind of informational value. Help me solve a problem, or understand a model of thinking better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-would-doing-or-implementing-x-improve-my-content&quot;&gt;How would doing (or implementing) ‚ÄúX‚Äù improve my content?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-would-doing-or-implementing-x-improve-my-content&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-would-doing-or-implementing-x-improve-my-content&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great question. Often when I ask myself this question, I‚Äôm considering the visual branding of an individual. But lately I‚Äôve also been thinking about how my favorite creators structure and pace the flow of information in their posts while balancing their voice. This is why it is a good idea to follow content creators that resonate with you, because everyone learns to strike this balance differently. And typically the more someone writes technical content, the more natural and easier to read they get.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-they-improve-upon-to-make-this-content-even-more-effective&quot;&gt;What can they improve upon to make this content even more effective?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-can-they-improve-upon-to-make-this-content-even-more-effective&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-can-they-improve-upon-to-make-this-content-even-more-effective&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least for me, it is easier to edit someone else‚Äôs work. Naturally, I‚Äôm constantly thinking about how little bits of friction can be smoothed out and so that I could understand it better. This could mean mixing the styles of creators together, and I try to identify creators who are particularly good (or sometimes bad) at one thing so I can pay attention to how their style evolves.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: conclusion&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know if this post will be useful to others, but it was a good exercise for me. If you‚Äôre a content creator, I encourage you to read through Stephanie‚Äôs original post. Ask yourself these questions and try to give concrete answers. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>What can I do to feel like I belong in the Tech community?</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was a teenager, in the 00‚Äôs, the internet gave me net-positive energy and optimism. It was still very novel, and there was a lot of opportunity to discover niche communities that overlapped with my interests. I felt like part of an in-crowd and it deeply influenced my life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have continuously been connected online (Metaphorically. Bc I grew up with dial-up). Much of the novelty has long worn off.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-s-been-an-exhausting-year&quot;&gt;It‚Äôs been an exhausting year&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#it-s-been-an-exhausting-year&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: it-s-been-an-exhausting-year&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was laid off early in the year due to the pandemic. Due to the sudden loss of human interaction, I have been revisiting some of that yearning for connection as I transition to starting a business from scratch (more about that some other time). As a necessity, I am dependent on the internet for the majority of my human interaction. Maybe this is me being mentally old, but I feel the current energy of my echochamber to be more net-negative and I‚Äôm hoping I can introduce myself to people who build others up. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Niche communities are difficult for me to discover with the same ease as when I was young. That‚Äôs not a reason enough for me to stop looking! So that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôll start looking where I‚Äôm at. For professional reasons, I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to start in Tech. So I‚Äôll need to be more specific, because Tech is HUGE.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;searching-for-my-k-nearest-neighbors&quot;&gt;Searching for my k-nearest neighbors&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#searching-for-my-k-nearest-neighbors&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: searching-for-my-k-nearest-neighbors&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôll spare you the rest of the thought exercise. I‚Äôve been focusing my efforts within the Rust community. Why? It‚Äôs reignited my joy in writing code again, and I‚Äôm trying to start my business with it. &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;insights.stackoverflow.com&#x2F;survey&#x2F;2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-loved&quot;&gt;And because people love it!&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a few years under my belt, I‚Äôve finally reached a point in my Rust development that I no longer consider myself a beginner and I can be productive. Great! Well, now what?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-have-i-been-doing&quot;&gt;What have I been doing?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-have-i-been-doing&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-have-i-been-doing&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regularly posting blog posts with a purpose of educating or sharing an experience as a non-expert&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hanging out around Tech Twitter and occasionally commenting and retweeting&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Streaming writing Rust code for a few hours at least once a week&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joining so many Slack&#x2F;Discord&#x2F;Matrix&#x2F;Gitter&#x2F;IRC communities. Mostly lurking, but participating occasionally&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintaining a &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;crates.io&#x2F;crates&#x2F;git-url-parse&quot;&gt;Rust crate&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and occasionally asking related projects if they would like to depend on it&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-have-i-been-expecting&quot;&gt;What have I been expecting?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-have-i-been-expecting&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-have-i-been-expecting&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of me was hoping eventually after seeing the same same faces, same names‚Ä¶ that I would feel like I had joined the community and I‚Äôd stop feeling so intimidated. Perhaps that I would have experienced some subtle mutual acknowledgement of acquaintance? (I have since been lowering my expectations, fwiw. I now believe it is my responsibility to initiate the interactions with potential personal meaning or expectation.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-have-i-not-been-doing&quot;&gt;What have I not been doing?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-have-i-not-been-doing&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-have-i-not-been-doing&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actively inviting conversation&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stepping out of my comfort zone to ask for feedback&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;won-t-you-be-my-neighbor&quot;&gt;Won‚Äôt you be my neighbor?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#won-t-you-be-my-neighbor&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: won-t-you-be-my-neighbor&quot;&gt;üîó&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When was the last time you joined a new community? What was the defining moment when you felt like you belonged?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt feel unwelcome in Tech, but I feel invisible. My attempts to extend my reach out to those who might actually care to connect has random-like results. Not for lack of trying. But admittedly, I am placing too much value in establishing consistency before figuring out what works for me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t know what options to try next. I‚Äôm not fishing for pity, but I am looking for advice. How do I find my audience? How can my audience find me?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
