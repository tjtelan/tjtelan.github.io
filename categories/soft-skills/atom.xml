		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post is in response to &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.stephaniemorillo.co&#x2F;post&#x2F;reading-more-technical-content-can-help-you-improve-your-content-creation-skills-here-s-how&quot;&gt;Stephanie Morillo’s post&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main piece of advice that is elaborated upon is to &lt;strong&gt;read a lot of technical content&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I think is very helpful about this post are the questions that are asked. I thought it would be a good idea to answer these questions so that I can share my opinions around how I read through technical content.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-do-i-like-a-piece-of-technical-content&quot;&gt;Why do I like a piece of technical content?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-do-i-like-a-piece-of-technical-content&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: why-do-i-like-a-piece-of-technical-content&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can answer this in different ways depending on the context that leads me to find technical content. The main two contexts being discovered through social media, or via a search engine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;through-social-media&quot;&gt;Through social media&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#through-social-media&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: through-social-media&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time on technical social media, like Reddit, Hacker News, Dev.to, and Twitter and I mostly only read the trending posts. So in these cases, an individual’s or company’s personality drives my interest over the actual content.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the time this leads to some cult of personality for popular posts in the comment section. This can’t be helped. However, this kind of engagement occasionally leads to interesting and tangential discussion. I like when the author can participate in the discussion as well, but this is a rare occurrence.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer concepts over code in the case of social media discovery. Emphasis when I’m reading through something that is about an ecosystem I don’t have experience using. I like having my hand held lightly, and guided through the examples with metaphor or images.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus points if you both provide links for more context, as well as provide a simplified summary. Help frame how I should think, and even give negative examples for how I should not think if it helps.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These posts are primarily to entertain me, and then to inform me. I want the attention to readability with layout and markup to be more considered. If there are images to help set tone, I’d rather they be well used memes, or diagrams.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;through-search&quot;&gt;Through search&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#through-search&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: through-search&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I’m searching for something technical, it’s more likely that I’m doing research, design or implementation. So personality may continue to play a role in my likelihood to revisit an article, but the code snippets and coherence of an explanation is more important.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus points if consideration was made for keyword searching or organized textbook-like. I don’t need my hand held as much in his case. Just point me in a direction. I don’t want the entire post to be read through carefully unless the post is about low-level detail.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be grumpy, but I will endure a post that is harder to skim if the content is promising enough.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-is-their-intended-audience&quot;&gt;Who is their intended audience?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#who-is-their-intended-audience&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: who-is-their-intended-audience&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of reading a lot of technical content means reading things that are not specifically targeted at myself.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the content involves discussion of code, I really prefer a lot of gentle, but explicit nudging around the skill level required to make sense of what is in the post.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wide audience is generally my least favorite because content has to be high-level enough to not lose anyone. If you’re aiming wide, then say so or be very obvious. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Textbook-style is good enough for me. Build up concepts in a reasonable sequence. Or link to posts or definitions that talk about foundational concepts that you’re introducing. Unless you’ve already stated an expected skill level, I will feel like you don’t know the audience you’re writing to.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-this-company-individual-do-really-well&quot;&gt;What does this (company&#x2F;individual) do really well?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-does-this-company-individual-do-really-well&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-does-this-company-individual-do-really-well&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of question is mostly for judging a collection of posts. Any single post may have left positive impressions on me of being informative, concise, funny, easy to read. But I don’t feel like I can judge what the competencies or patterns of a company or individual is until I see other work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look for consistency in voice. Are we having a conversation. Am I reading a monologue? Do you know where your content beats and break things up with whitespace or images? Are you flexible enough with how you present ideas so that I understand you or know what homework I have in order to understand? Visual branding also comes into mind when discussing consistency. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-this-content-help-me-do&quot;&gt;What does this content help me do?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-does-this-content-help-me-do&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-does-this-content-help-me-do&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My expectations of what the content offers me is again, dependent on the context in which I was introduced.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, if it is through social media, I’m looking first to have some kind of entertainment aspect. I’m looking for a breadth of information that allows me to insert my own ideas. I know that content creators aren’t always in control of where and when their content is posted, so this isn’t always going to be fair to judge entertainment value when the content is informational. But it is a plus if the author can be engaging and educational because it takes effort to do well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, if it is through organic search, I’m looking for some kind of informational value. Help me solve a problem, or understand a model of thinking better.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-would-doing-or-implementing-x-improve-my-content&quot;&gt;How would doing (or implementing) “X” improve my content?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-would-doing-or-implementing-x-improve-my-content&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-would-doing-or-implementing-x-improve-my-content&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great question. Often when I ask myself this question, I’m considering the visual branding of an individual. But lately I’ve also been thinking about how my favorite creators structure and pace the flow of information in their posts while balancing their voice. This is why it is a good idea to follow content creators that resonate with you, because everyone learns to strike this balance differently. And typically the more someone writes technical content, the more natural and easier to read they get.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-can-they-improve-upon-to-make-this-content-even-more-effective&quot;&gt;What can they improve upon to make this content even more effective?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-can-they-improve-upon-to-make-this-content-even-more-effective&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: what-can-they-improve-upon-to-make-this-content-even-more-effective&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least for me, it is easier to edit someone else’s work. Naturally, I’m constantly thinking about how little bits of friction can be smoothed out and so that I could understand it better. This could mean mixing the styles of creators together, and I try to identify creators who are particularly good (or sometimes bad) at one thing so I can pay attention to how their style evolves.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: conclusion&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if this post will be useful to others, but it was a good exercise for me. If you’re a content creator, I encourage you to read through Stephanie’s original post. Ask yourself these questions and try to give concrete answers. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<title>Taking Notes</title>
		<published>2015-07-16T00:00:00+00:00</published>
		<updated>2015-07-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
		<link rel="alternate" href="https://tjtelan.com/blog/taking-notes/" type="text/html"/>
		<id>https://tjtelan.com/blog/taking-notes/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;ve carrired a bound, grid paper &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bookfactory.com&#x2F;engineering-notebooks&#x2F;engineering-notebooks.html&quot;&gt;engineering notebook&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for quite a few years now. (A habit I picked up in school from the Electrical Engineering side of my formal education.) I&#x27;ve written an entry for (almost) every day working.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons why this has been my preference to text-based note taking, for example: a simple text file, or more complex, a wiki&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;low-tech-solution-for-a-low-tech-problem&quot;&gt;Low-tech solution for a low-tech problem&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#low-tech-solution-for-a-low-tech-problem&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: low-tech-solution-for-a-low-tech-problem&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I need to write a to-do list, or a reminder for myself while I&#x27;m away from my desk, it is a lot easier to jot something down and be done. I don&#x27;t require to be near a text-editor. I don&#x27;t need to create a wiki page, or do any post-markup to what I&#x27;ve written.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I&#x27;m free to use a page however I need to in order to get my thought onto the page. I&#x27;m not limited to software features for my visual metaphors if I&#x27;m sketching out a diagram, or using common symbols&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-downsides&quot;&gt;The downsides&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-downsides&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-downsides&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach has bitten me a few times. When I&#x27;ve started in with a new notebook in the middle of a project (since bound books have limited pages) I&#x27;m stuck carrying 2 books for a while.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Text searching features don&#x27;t exist in my books. At least not without scanning and OCR (Making the assumtion that my handwriting is neat enough to be read into a text form, which is an unrealistic assumption.)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-for-a-balance&quot;&gt;Looking for a balance&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#looking-for-a-balance&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: looking-for-a-balance&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It got me thinking about what I needed to do if I wanted to go all digital with my note taking, but keep my workflow intact.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feeling of using a softer tip on a phone screen requires too much of a change to how I naturally write. I end up concentrating more just to make sure I write legibly enough for myself. Recently, I bought a &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Adonit-Android-Samsung-Windows-Tablets&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B00R33ZYCG&#x2F;ref=sr_1_1?s=pc&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1437058896&amp;amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;hard-tipped stylus&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for my phone, since my experiences with other rubber tipped styli were underwhelming. An argument can be made about the price for a good styli. The good reviews start at about $20-30. A large commitment for an instrument that is only good on touch screens.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use an Android phone, and, at least at the time of this writing, there aren&#x27;t a lot of great hand writing tools. Most are marketed towards the digital artist. Lots of authoring features I don&#x27;t need, and some that are missing for creating journal entries.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=com.fiistudio.fiinote&quot;&gt;Fiinote&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; so far has been my favorite. I get a good mix of hand-written options, hand-drawn, text-based. And I can create hyperlinks, and embed images if I choose to. It has only been a few days, but if the free version is this great, the obvious choice may be to support the developers by upgrading to the full version.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: conclusion&quot;&gt;🔗&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend writing your notes down. There have been many &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.scientificamerican.com&#x2F;article&#x2F;a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop&#x2F;&quot;&gt;articles&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.psychologicalscience.org&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;news&#x2F;were-only-human&#x2F;ink-on-paper-some-notes-on-note-taking.html&quot;&gt;studies&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; about the cognitive advantages of longhand vs keyboarding for note taking.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard-tipped styli are pretty great, and cost about as much as nicer ink pens (~$25-100+).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good, free software for handwriting exists for handwriting. Great, paid software undoubtedly exists.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#x27;s to a successful experiment!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
