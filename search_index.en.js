(Then I took a long break from posting.) Before I get started on more tech writing for 2021, I wanted to stop and reflect on this effort.\nHow did it go?🔗\nPretty well, to be honest. It has been one of the most challenging goals I’ve set for myself. After the 50% mark, I had exhausted the developed ideas in my backlog so it became harder to get in front of my schedule. I had to start the next post immediately after publishing.\nI found a few insights while building my habit for writing, and you might find them helpful, too.\n1. The hardest part is getting started🔗\nIt’s easy to say that some of this is due to the mood of 2020, but it was really easy to fall into self-doubt and self-rejection based on the worry that no one would read what I was going to write. Or that people would read it, but they’d hate it.\nThese are still feelings that I sometimes have today. But aside from SEO, marketing on social media, experimenting with the time I post, and other tasks that take effort – whether or not someone clicks and reads is out of my control.\nDue to the mental effort required to overcome these feelings, the hardest part of writing is getting started. As such, it (almost) doesn’t matter what the resulting quality is. Primarily what matters is getting something on one topic on the page, to edit later. \n2. Editing is easier than writing🔗\nI have a much easier time editing than writing from scratch. Knowing this about myself meant that it was a lot more important to complete any kind of first draft, no matter how bad.\nThe editing phase takes at least twice as long as writing. This phase may involve complete rewrites of sections, but I still consider that to be less difficult than starting from a blank page. It’s also a lot easier to judge how much I have left to do when the edits are focused on formatting and pacing, and less on content or coherency. \n3. Don’t be a perfectionist🔗\nAt least for the content that I’m creating, most people aren’t going to suddenly understand a complicated concept because I wrote a specific sentence in a particular way.\nFor the goal I was working toward, it was important to post on a predictable schedule. While it’s good to set your own standards for yourself high, keep in mind that it’s impossible to level up 10x with a single post. Writing well takes practice, and you get more practice if you are able to let go, call a story done, and move on to writing something else.\n4. Writing consistently doesn’t always yield consistent quality🔗\nI’ll be the first to admit that I think some of my posts are more useful or interesting to read than others. That’s just how it goes sometimes, where ambitions are better than the content produced.\nIra Glass spoke about storytelling and the taste gap (and how to close it). He encourages that the most important thing one can do when starting out is to produce quantity over quality. Over time you improve, if you can endure this creative, iterative phase. It is normal for quality to lag behind your ambitions. \nWith that in mind, it’s okay to write things that you never publish. I’ve learned that writing can be a method for understanding a topic, or just organizing my thoughts. Not all of that needs to be public.\nWhat continued to give me encouragement was noticing that my first draft quality was (on average) getting better over time. That was a measurable improvement! \n5. Be really specific about who you are talking to🔗\nWhen I write, I always start the first draft always with a question: Who am I writing to?\nIt doesn’t always matter if the answer is a real person. This person I’m writing to might be based on my past experience, questions people have asked me, interactions I’ve observed, an organization, or just completely made up!\nWhat is most important is that I focus my message so my intended target audience understands. I don’t want to unintentionally expand the audience or over-explain a concept if it doesn’t benefit the base group of people I am writing to. This technique has made it a lot easier to write in bursts, and edit for clarity. It helps each piece of writing have a consistent voice.\n6. Writing titles is hard (because SEO is hard)🔗\nI have to admit: I change the title of each post no less than 3 times, sometimes minutes before publishing the post!\nDifferent publishing platforms have different audiences, so experiment with what works for your readers. If you plan on cross-posting across multiple platforms or you want to be discovered through search engines, you will need to learn a little bit about marketing and SEO. \nI’m frequently torn between using technical jargon in my titles, or less specific concepts that can be generally applied.\nPlaying with this balance is a cheap and interesting game that, in my experience, avoids disappointment by taking a long-term perspective. It’s been validating to see what kind of content does well though organic search visits vs. people sharing links. I’m still caught off guard when an article from many months ago begins to trend. The lesson here is to be patient and see what strategies pay off.\n7. Keep a backlog of ideas🔗\nI have a spreadsheet that I use to keep track of ideas in various states. When I think of something that might be a good topic to explore in a post, I add it to the list. These can be title ideas, posts that are in progress, and links to drafts. \nI try not to dismiss an idea too early. Just writing it down gets it out of my mind, with low pressure to fully explore the idea. Sometimes this collection of thoughts ends up presenting patterns or themes that, when combined, contain enough material to create a full post around. This strategy is really practical, and comes in handy when I am feeling like I’m in a creative rut. If I have a deadline to meet, I can always pull from the pile of ideas I already had.\n8. Building structure and motivation for writing is moving target🔗\nI am generally informed about trending topics within tech, but I’m trying to discover my niche and I don’t want to spend an eternity looking for ideas. I’ve also discovered that I’m most creative when I have constraints and have a structure to lean on.\nI have a long-term goal to work for myself creating educational products / services / consulting. So a structure I lean into is that each post contributes to that long-term goal. \nIt’s also important to address shorter-term motivation. My approach has been to identify what motivates me to create, and then slowly build systems to support producing content. Aside from the obvious need to set aside time to write, creating that motivation for a post takes three things: \n\nThe content has to be something that is not too difficult for me to create. This means I mostly know the material I’m talking about, and I’m not learning new skills specifically for the post. (It’s not uncommon for me to write about a learning experience, though! I just don’t set out to learn how to do something specifically to write a post)\nSomething I enjoy creating - The topic I’m writing about needs to be interesting, or the story I’m telling needs to be meaningful. Otherwise, I’ll get bored writing it (or you’ll get bored reading it).\nThe result should provide value to someone else. People value their time, so in writing an article, I’m trading my time writing for someone’s time savings. What I communicate can save people time, and that’s meaningful to me. I know I have benefitted from others doing the same.\n\nI really enjoy creating software developer advocacy and tech education content, and the topics I (mostly) write on reinforce these areas.\nI aspire to have objectives that can be described as SMART. Admittedly, my short- and long-term goals are still pretty abstract. I think that’s okay right now, as long as I am making progress in the right direction.\n9. Don’t be afraid to be seen trying🔗\nCredit to a video by Evelyn From The Internets for helping me articulate my feelings about this point.\nThis relates to my previous point of starting being the hardest part. Some of my internal friction stems from the feeling of being afraid to be seen trying something I’m not good at.\nWith some rare exceptions, I’ve decided to keep my old content online. It likely won’t be an issue where stuff I created in the past while I was still learning has embarrassed me. Largely, this content is ignored and no one but myself cares about it. \nTo be concise, haters gonna hate. That’s what they do. So don’t pay any attention to the inconsiderate folks who “just want to help” but are not actually helpful. The tech community is full of strong personalities that aren’t always inviting or pleasant to engage with. (I’m not saying this is the majority. I see you...) \nI see enough 💩 being talked in social media threads that it constantly occupies space in my mind when I’m about to publish a new piece of content. However, the truth is that most people are not focused on you for even a moment. So a way I like to view that is that most people will not even see you fail – that’s the blessing of no one knowing who you are yet. Therefore, there’s no reason to not try.\nConclusion🔗\nBuilding a writing habit has been very humbling. I learned that I actually know a lot less about certain topics than I thought. I had to research more than I expected. But as I gained experience, I leveled up my time management and my process.\nNow that I’m not trying to post weekly, what I would do differently is to spend more time developing my production processes. And that’s what the focus of this next year will be about.\nAside from continuing to stream my product development on Twitch, this year I will be creating short videos, starting with some of my more popular blog posts as topics. I hope this will lead into more types of educational content, and more opportunities to work with other people in achieving their goals.\nI started a consulting business (Figbee Labs) in the latter half of 2020. I will continue to travel out of my comfort zone into the deeper waters and hopefully meet new people or organizations that want to work together. It’s important to me to help people from all backgrounds succeed in sustainably building and running their own software products. I will document my experience over 2021 through posts and various social media. \nIf you’ve undertaken a similar challenge, what did you learn about your process? What do you want to achieve with writing this year?\n","description":"A reflection on writing a lot more in 2020","id":"https://tjtelan.com/blog/9-insights-i-uncovered-while-building-writing-habit/","path":"/blog/9-insights-i-uncovered-while-building-writing-habit/","title":"9 Insights I Uncovered While Building a Writing Habit"},"https://tjtelan.com/blog/belonging-in-the-tech-community/":{"body":"When I was a teenager, in the 00’s, the internet gave me net-positive energy and optimism. It was still very novel, and there was a lot of opportunity to discover niche communities that overlapped with my interests. I felt like part of an in-crowd and it deeply influenced my life.\nI have continuously been connected online (Metaphorically. Bc I grew up with dial-up). Much of the novelty has long worn off.\nIt’s been an exhausting year🔗\nI was laid off early in the year due to the pandemic. Due to the sudden loss of human interaction, I have been revisiting some of that yearning for connection as I transition to starting a business from scratch (more about that some other time). As a necessity, I am dependent on the internet for the majority of my human interaction. Maybe this is me being mentally old, but I feel the current energy of my echochamber to be more net-negative and I’m hoping I can introduce myself to people who build others up. \nNiche communities are difficult for me to discover with the same ease as when I was young. That’s not a reason enough for me to stop looking! So that’s fine. I’ll start looking where I’m at. For professional reasons, I need to start in Tech. So I’ll need to be more specific, because Tech is HUGE.\n\nSearching for my k-nearest neighbors🔗\nI’ll spare you the rest of the thought exercise. I’ve been focusing my efforts within the Rust community. Why? It’s reignited my joy in writing code again, and I’m trying to start my business with it. And because people love it! \nWith a few years under my belt, I’ve finally reached a point in my Rust development that I no longer consider myself a beginner and I can be productive. Great! Well, now what?\nWhat have I been doing?🔗\n\nRegularly posting blog posts with a purpose of educating or sharing an experience as a non-expert\nHanging out around Tech Twitter and occasionally commenting and retweeting\nStreaming writing Rust code for a few hours at least once a week\nJoining so many Slack/Discord/Matrix/Gitter/IRC communities. Mostly lurking, but participating occasionally\nMaintaining a Rust crate and occasionally asking related projects if they would like to depend on it\n\nWhat have I been expecting?🔗\nPart of me was hoping eventually after seeing the same same faces, same names… that I would feel like I had joined the community and I’d stop feeling so intimidated. Perhaps that I would have experienced some subtle mutual acknowledgement of acquaintance? (I have since been lowering my expectations, fwiw. I now believe it is my responsibility to initiate the interactions with potential personal meaning or expectation.)\nWhat have I not been doing?🔗\n\nActively inviting conversation\nStepping out of my comfort zone to ask for feedback\n\nWon’t you be my neighbor?🔗\nWhen was the last time you joined a new community? What was the defining moment when you felt like you belonged?\nI don’t feel unwelcome in Tech, but I feel invisible. My attempts to extend my reach out to those who might actually care to connect has random-like results. Not for lack of trying. But admittedly, I am placing too much value in establishing consistency before figuring out what works for me.\nI don't know what options to try next. I’m not fishing for pity, but I am looking for advice. How do I find my audience? How can my audience find me?\n\nJoin the discussion on my post at Dev.to or on Twitter\n","description":"A reflection and invitation to discuss my current lack of feeling of belonging in the tech community","id":"https://tjtelan.com/blog/belonging-in-the-tech-community/","path":"/blog/belonging-in-the-tech-community/","title":"What can I do to feel like I belong in the Tech community?"},"https://tjtelan.com/blog/bottle-rockets-in-my-devops/":{"body":"Why is DevOps such a hot trend when many find it hard to concretely define? It is just for big companies? Could you be practicing DevOps as a small software organization and not even know it? What are the outputs of DevOps activities? How do you explain DevOps to your less-technical colleagues?\nTo help address those questions, I want to tell you a story not about software, but instead about bottle rockets. We’ll take a look at typical DevOps activities and how feedback loops can naturally form and provide opportunities for improvement using DevOps thinking.\n\nImagine you are building a company that makes and shoots off fireworks. You’re just starting out, so you’re the one making the fireworks.\nThe firework is aimed, a fuse is lit, the rocket launches, and features are displayed to your customers. You intentionally design pyrotechnics with an expected outcome. Your customers love the loop-de-loops, whistling, and colorful sparks!\nAt first, you’re just building customized fireworks by yourself with cheap kits. Based on positive feedback from customers, you start to develop a specific type of firework. \nThis is essentially how all software products start.\nYou soon outgrow the capabilities and customizability offered through the kits, and to save on money you develop your own process using raw materials. You build and package every single unit in your garage, and have fireworks shows in a field next to your house. People are buying tickets to your fireworks shows, regardless of how the product was built -- they just want a cool explosion (and yours are the coolest). \nWhat your audience doesn't see are the many experiments and failures that went into building their experience. However, since you work alone, any mishaps are in your private space and they are easy to put out with a fire extinguisher and a bucket of water.\nThis is similar to software development.\nYour company wants to expand their market size and offerings. You hire new people to help you build more of what currently sells, as well as help create new designs based on feedback from customers. Building in your garage no longer suits the needs of the business. \nThis is similar to the start of some legends in software development.\nYou move into a bigger warehouse with an indoor launchpad. You teach the new people how you work. You build and package units by hand. The new people are not as good at this as you are and they don’t have your intuition, so the quality of output is not as consistent. \nYou’re now launching your bottle rockets from inside the warehouse, through a window. The inconsistencies sometimes cause a small fire so everyone has to stop what they’re doing to help put it out.\nYou spend the money or time and effort to create special tools so that they don’t needlessly make mistakes.\nThis is similar to dev tooling. Dev tooling is domain-specific software or automation created for the purpose of helping developers keep their focus on the details of their problem. It also helps developers to offload the mental burden of tedious tasks such as data processing, reformatting, or validation, onto their tools.\nYour company now creates many different types of fireworks, and has showcase displays every week. Every product uses specialized parts so it can be a scramble to get everything done in time. One of your new bottle rocket designers discovers that with a few small modifications, many of your products could use the same, adjustable fuse. Now, many firework designs can be made at the same time, and each fuse can be adjusted in the field prior to ignition. You apply this strategy to other parts and this improves your manufacturing efficiency.\nThis is similar to microservice architecture, a style of service-oriented architecture design that enables an application to be composed of several small modules organized by business capabilities. These modules can be developed and updated ad-hoc without requiring a full redeployment of all components.\nYou get late notice there’s going to be a huge fireworks expo very soon, and your company’s unique fireworks will be the star of the show. \nYou return to the product lines to assist with packing units. It’s a terrible experience. \nThe work is manual, and for some of the tasks you realize that the same tools can be used by an assembly machine and performed with more precision and consistency. With some extra effort, more machines could be constructed to create units for quality control testing, and package units for shipping. The process of assembly, packing, and launch preparation is now more standardized, and your human workers can focus on designing better fireworks instead of remembering the exact order and specifications of assembly.\nThis is similar to CI/CD (continuous integration / continuous delivery/deployment). CI/CD is a process that connects development (writing the code) to operations (running the code).\nTypically initiated by a developer pushing code, which builds, tests. This process is called Continuous Integration (CI). The end of a CI process that results in an artifact ready to be deployed is called Continuous Delivery. Going one step further to an automatic deployment of the artifact into production is called Continuous Deployment.\nAs your rockets get bigger, you notice that the aiming from the launchpad isn’t going as well as it used to. With the smaller rockets, you were able to eyeball the right trajectory, but this isn’t working as well with these more complex fireworks. Due to your previous standardizations of fuses, the same fuse modules are used for all the rockets. Therefore we can narrow our investigation of the trajectory issues specifically to construction of the complex fireworks. Quality control is now also improved because there are fewer variants introduced. Changes are easier to track and correct using information from internal quality control and from customers.\nThis is observation through metrics and monitoring. The trajectory was noticed not only holistically because of regular launches internally, and by customers. But also objectively, because we’ve collected data on the distances experienced in a variety of conditions.\nYou’re building bigger and better bottle rockets, and your customers are thrilled with the exciting displays you’re putting on! They’ve never seen brighter colors or more interesting designs!\nConclusion🔗\nUsing this somewhat silly story as a stand-in for the software development and deployment process, you can see that DevOps activities are often part of a developing and growing system. With every deployment, you’re trying to shoot a bottle rocket out of the window. \nPicking and choosing DevOps activities to optimize is normal for small but growing software organizations. Be pragmatic. Adopt solutions when you have problems they solve. \nSo how do you know what you actually need? You’re likely already addressing the needs you have (but in a much less efficient way). Interested in investing in your team’s DevOps practice? Here are some starting points to think about:\n\nIf your team spends a lot of time moving between projects, consider bulking up your dev tooling.\nIf you frequently find yourself solving the same problem repeatedly or copy/pasting and lightly modifying service code, investigate implementing microservice architecture to do that job for you.\nIf you rely on a single developer’s machine or struggle to consistently build or release minor changes, CI/CD could be what you’re missing.\nIf you make changes based on feelings and not with data, then improve your product observation through collecting metrics and monitoring.\n\nA cohesive strategy for packaging, deployment, and response is essential as growth occurs. As the rate of updates increase, the rate of outage-causing failures climbs proportionally. \nIt is fatally optimistic to rely on the hope that your product is absent of critical bugs. Reactivity is not a dependable plan, especially in the high-stress situations caused when your bottle rocket explodes on the launchpad. Instead, assume that things will inevitably go wrong sometime, somewhere. Create tangible strategies that bridge writing code (development) and running code (operations) through common language and goals, and rely on procedures that considered the important details back when stress levels were not high. \n","description":"Why DevOps thinking is not new.

It’s more likely than you think."},"https://tjtelan.com/blog/building-a-unix-shell-in-rust-part-1/":{"body":"My goal is to find more work opportunities to write in Rust the same way I can write in Python and Go. Since I spend a lot of time designing and executing automation, it felt useful to start somewhere familiar. How about a simple Unix shell? Yes, I use bash all the time.\nRather than get this all worked out before posting, I'm going to document as much of my thought process in the design, as I have it. (But I am editing this to spare you the noisier stream-of-consciousness experience.)\nI'll have code snippets occasionally, but I'm trying to keep the audience around intermediate experience (where I consider myself to be today). I'm going to assume you use another programming language today to Get Shit Done, and use the terminal to do simple things, but not necessarily write shell scripts.\nWhy am I doing this? I don't often see posts from beginning Rust learners doing practical, simple things (that can simply be copy/pasted and modified slightly), like in the other more mature language communities... Widest market? Probably not. \nI guess that's enough rambling. Let’s dive in.\n\nWhat’s a shell?🔗\nA shell is an interactive language interpreter that allows you to run text-based commands and translates them into an action, such as making internal function calls, or running external programs.\nYou usually use it to access resources from the operating system. \nAdditional to accepting a text command - it typically outputs text results and/or causes some other side-effect.\nYou may know some of the name brand shells like the kind we're making, a Unix shell:\n\nBourne-shell (sh)\nbash\nzsh\nfish\n\nOr the windows specific:\n\nCommand Prompt (cmd.exe)\nPowershell\n\nOr interpreted languages:\n\npython \nlua\nhaskell \n\nShells run in terminal emulators. This is (over-) simplified as the text-only window that runs your shell. \nIt handles the interaction from you (known as Standard-In, like keystrokes) and your shell (known as Standard-Out for the buffered/flushed output style, and Standard-Error for the direct output style).\nIn most cases, the terminal emulator and shell are different processes (Windows’ cmd.exe and Powershell are confusingly, both the shell and terminal emulator) \nYou may have made reference to it by other common names such as:\n\ncommand prompt\nterminal\nconsole\n\nExamples of some terminal emulators\n\nxterm\nrxvt\niTerm\nTerminal.app\nWindows Command Prompt\nPowershell\n\nI’m going to focus on writing a bash-like shell. Functionality, and syntax should feel familiar. \n\nThe shells are a REPL, a Read-Eval-Print-Loop.\nTypically, a character (let’s say ‘$’) is printed and a cursor blinks. This informs the user that a command can be typed in.\nYou type in a command.\nYou hit enter to translate the command into an action.\nThe output of the program prints to the screen.\n$ \n\nWhat does this mean for me?🔗\nIt lets us quickly stub the code out into this REPL  pattern \nOur main function that will enter a loop. Inside the main loop, we request a command from the user, and do something. Then we do it all over again. \nBreaking down the steps🔗\nFirst we Read🔗\nWe need to take user input. Most shells print a symbol to signal to the user that we can input a command (as opposed to, for example, executing a command). I need to learn how to get a text command from the user. \nLet's start our definition of a command. \nCommand\n\na series of words separated by spaces.\n\n$ keyword arg1 arg2 arg3… \n\nThe first word is a keyword. It's either a built-in function or an executable on the filesystem, with the rest of the line being parameters passed to our function. \nKeyword\n\nOne of 2 possibilities :\n\nA built-in function to the shell (that is, calling a function in the code)\nAn executable\n\nEither in one of the directories in your PATH\nOr a filesystem path (relative or absolute)\n\n\n\n\nThen we Execute🔗\nWhen we use a command that calls a built-in, we simply pass the arguments to the function, and return back to the start of the loop when it completes. \nAnd when we call an executable?🔗\nWe need to make a fork syscall, that is, create a new process for the executable to run in, so it can have its own memory space, and manage its own interactions with the operating system. (The shell is still the parent process) \nTo start a process inside the child process, we have to call the exec syscall. \nThen we Process🔗\nThis is when we cause side-effects to the system.\nWe want to provide feedback to the user to let them know the results of this process. To keep this simple, we will only consider returning text to the user, as we are providing commands as text. \nOur shell process has at least 3 file descriptors for passing input, or receiving output provided. Stdin, Stdout, and Stderr. I need to know how to do that purely with Rust. \nAfter the process is complete, any output should be printed to the screen, via stdout or stderr.\nExit codes will be treated as binary for this exercise. It should be set to 0 if we exit without error. Otherwise the exit code will be 1.\nLastly, we Loop🔗\nReturn of control will go back to the user. The default user prompt will print as a visual cue (along with the typical blinking cursor) and we should be able to enter another command. \nThe coding strategy🔗\nSo then we're running commands. Let's review the strategy. \n\nI need to know how to take input command in a loop. \nI need to process the input to separate the keyword from the arguments \nI need a way to call both builtins and executables. \nThe most abstract : I need to give the user feedback about the command run. (E. g. Print onto screen as appropriate and set an exit code of the command.) \n\nIn the next post, we'll dive into using cargo and  start writing in Rust. \n","description":"Description of concepts of a Unix shell","id":"https://tjtelan.com/blog/building-a-unix-shell-in-rust-part-1/","path":"/blog/building-a-unix-shell-in-rust-part-1/","title":"Building a Unix-shell in Rust - Part 1"},"https://tjtelan.com/blog/building-a-unix-shell-in-rust-part-2/":{"body":"This is the 2nd part of a series where I document writing a command shell in Rust. In the previous post I reviewed what a shell is, and broke that down into stages I can use to organize my code.\nGetting user input🔗\nFirst thing we need to do is create a project. Let’s use Cargo to create this for us.\n$ cargo new --bin rust-shell\n\nFor now, I'm going to assume we are only running interactively. So I'm just going to get a simple loop set up that asks for an input, and echoes it back to me.\nuse std::io;\n\nfn main() {\n  loop {\n    let mut command = String::new();\n    io::stdin().read_line(&amp;mut command)\n      .expect(\"Failed to read in command\");\n    println!(\"{0}\", command);\n  }\n}\n\nI’m using std::io to read input into the mutable command variable binding, then I println() to echo my input back to the screen.\nThen we build:\n$ cargo build\n   Compiling rust-shell v0.1.0 (file:///Users/telant/src/rust-shell)\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.25 secs\n\nNo errors.\nAnd testing it out:\n$ cargo run\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs\n     Running `target/debug/rust-shell`\n123\n123\n\ntest\ntest\n\nGreat. Looks like that was easy.\nWhat we see here is me trying 2 commands: 123 and test. We see the command printed right back. (Printing a short prompt might make that more obvious… ) \nParsing the input into tokens🔗\nNext step is to break the user input from a single continuous string into smaller pieces that we can evaluate. \nI am just going to tokenize the string using spaces as delimiters (because it is easy. It is, however, not always accurate, but, Dear Reader, I already know this is not the final way I am going to implement tokens. Splitting on spaces is too greedy of an approach. Quoted arguments are usually evaluated to be a single argument, including spaces, for uses that include passing entire raw strings to other programs. Let's not get perfection distract us. I'll stay focused on getting something that works...)\nI actually ran into a little bit of trouble getting this working on a single line, with the original variable because of the type checker.\nThis did not work:\n$ cargo build\n   Compiling rust-shell v0.1.0 (file:///Users/telant/src/rust-shell)\nerror[E0282]: unable to infer enough type information about `B`\n  --&gt; src/main.rs:11:41\n   |\n11 |     println!(\"{:?}\", command.split(' ').collect());\n   |                                         ^^^^^^^ cannot infer type for `B`\n   |\n   = note: type annotations or generic parameter binding required\n\nI’m lazy, and I didn’t look into how to explicitly reference the type.\nThis did work. \nlet command_split : Vec&lt;&amp;str&gt; = command.split(' ').collect();\nprintln!(\"{:?}\", command_split);\n\nThis is the relevant output\ntest test test\n[\"test\", \"test\", \"test\\n\"]\n\nblah blah \"string in quotes\"\n[\"blah\", \"blah\", \"\\\"string\", \"in\", \"quotes\\\"\\n\"]\n\nI’m going to have to learn how type inference works in Rust sooner or later, but I’m not going to deal with it now. String types in Rust are kind of confusing coming from Python where I don’t have to deal with types very often.\n(This is a warning from the future. You should lightly understand the idiomatic difference between String and &amp;str. You find this out the hard way when you get to refactoring… see you in the future)\nI’m going to use this moment to make the interface a more obvious when the we are ready to take user input by printing a prompt character.\nuse std::io::{self,Write};\n\nfn main() {\n  let prompt_char = \"%\";\n  loop {\n    print!(\"{0} \", prompt_char);\n    io::stdout().flush().unwrap();\n\n    let mut command = String::new();\n    io::stdin().read_line(&amp;mut command)\n      .expect(\"Failed to read in command\");\n    println!(\"DEBUG: {:?}\", command);\n\n    let command_split : Vec&lt;&amp;str&gt; = command.split(' ').collect();\n    println!(\"DEBUG: {:?}\", command_split);\n  }\n}\n\nI added DEBUG: to our debug statements. Also I had to include a new use, use the print! macro, and flush the buffer so it would print to the screen immediately.\nI got this pattern from the Rust docs for print!\n$ cargo run\n    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs\n     Running `target/debug/rust-shell`\n% Feeling a little more shell-like now\nDEBUG: \"Feeling a little more shell-like now\\n\"\nDEBUG: [\"Feeling\", \"a\", \"little\", \"more\", \"shell-like\", \"now\\n\"]\n%\n\nClassifying parsed input🔗\nLast thing I’m going to do is identify the keyword from the arguments, then I’ll do a little refactoring to help organize the new complexity. (I expect to do a little fighting with the borrow checker at this point.)\nGetting the keyword is easy. I just need to pick off the first element of our tokenized command.\nThe arguments is a vector slice of everything but the first element of the command. Can I slice a vector as easily as slicing lists in Python? Yes.\nuse std::io::{self,Write};\n\nfn main() {\n  let prompt_char = \"%\";\n  loop {\n    print!(\"{0} \", prompt_char);\n    io::stdout().flush().unwrap();\n\n    let mut command = String::new();\n    io::stdin().read_line(&amp;mut command)\n      .expect(\"Failed to read in command\");\n    println!(\"DEBUG: Raw input: {:?}\", command);\n\n    let command_split : Vec&lt;&amp;str&gt; = command.split(' ').collect();\n    println!(\"DEBUG: Split input: {:?}\", command_split);\n\n    let keyword = command_split[0];\n    let arguments = &amp;command_split[1..];\n\n    println!(\"DEBUG: Keyword: {0}\", keyword);\n    println!(\"DEBUG: Number of arguments: {0:?}\\nDEBUG: Arguments: {1:?}\", arguments.len(), arguments);\n  }\n}\n\nI have to call the slice by reference using &amp; with the vector, and I specified the range I wanted to slice with the element I want to start from and .. without an ending element. Rust figures out the bounds in this case.\nTime to refactor!🔗\nI’m going to make the main loop look a little more functional (inside the loop).\nPrinting the prompt? Easy. Function call.\nfn print_prompt() {\n  let prompt_char = \"%\";\n\n  print!(\"{0} \", prompt_char);\n  io::stdout().flush().unwrap();\n}\n\nReading the command from user input? I had to look up how to return variables. The style is to use an implicit return, and no semicolon. You can use return, but it isn't very idiomatic. \nfn read_command() -&gt; String {\n    let mut command = String::new();\n    io::stdin().read_line(&amp;mut command)\n      .expect(\"Failed to read in command\");\n    println!(\"DEBUG: Raw input: {:?}\", command);\n\n    command\n}\n\nTokenizing the command? Gonna get a little more complicated. I’m going to set up a struct to represent the command so I can keep the tokenized command together in a single object.\n\nOptional : First fight with borrow checker🔗\nI almost lost the motivation to continue the documenting my thought process because of this obstacle. This section can be skipped if you are looking to follow my happy path, and don't want to follow my confusion. \n(This is what I wrote first, when I was actually having a fight with the borrow checker…)\nI have to learn a little bit about lifetimes in order to get this to compile. This makes some sense, since the struct will need to own the slice data, and in the original code, we were just borrowing the slice.\nI’m finding it confusing thinking about what I need to do in order to make the tokenizing function use the Command struct. If I can copy the args to the struct, and give ownership of the string to the struct, then I assume this will compile?\nWhat type is the copied slice, and how do I specify that in the struct? How do I use the lifetime in code to find my use case? I don’t even know what other questions to ask next.\nRather than try to figure out how to compile, and get the struct working with tokenizing the command, I’ll try to play around in main() and try instantiating my struct.\nWhat I need to be able to do is copy the data in the vector. I tried for a while trying to pass ownership of a slice, but I ended up finding a way to take the first element out of the vector, and having the rest be the arguments be what is left. I feel a little over my head at this point, and I’m going to spend some time reading the docs.\nThis is what the struct looked like.\n/// Bad.\nstruct Command &lt;'a&gt; {\n   keyword : String,\n   arguments : &amp;'a [&amp;'a str],\n }\n\nThe reason I went with this approach was I thought I could pass the ownership of the heap from when I split the command by whitespace. This was really not a good approach, and I wasted quite a lot of time fighting with the borrow checker.\n\nBack to the show🔗\nI ended up changing the way I split the original command string so I would have a Vec rather than Vec&lt;&amp;str&gt;. Because String is owned and &amp;str is borrowed, and the Command struct needs to own its data. \nI think I have a much more straightforward function.\nstruct Command {\n  keyword : String,\n  args : Vec&lt;String&gt;,\n}\n\nfn tokenize_command(c : String) -&gt; Command {\n  let mut command_split : Vec&lt;String&gt; = c.split_whitespace().map(|s| s.to_string()).collect();\n  println!(\"DEBUG: Split input: {:?}\", command_split);\n\n  let command = Command {\n    keyword : command_split.remove(0),\n    args : command_split,\n  };\n\n  command\n}\n\nBefore getting to the next step of evaluating the parsed command, I want to take a moment to learn how to set up tests that will run with the builds. See you next time. \n","description":"Beginning to interactive shell with Rust","id":"https://tjtelan.com/blog/building-a-unix-shell-in-rust-part-2/","path":"/blog/building-a-unix-shell-in-rust-part-2/","title":"Building a Unix-shell in Rust - Part 2"},"https://tjtelan.com/blog/building-a-unix-shell-in-rust-part-3/":{"body":"This is the third post in a series on writing a simple shell in the Rust language. (I suggest you start from the beginning!) \nIn the previous post , I implemented a simple REPL that simply prints out debug output with the input split by whitespace.\n\nIn this post, I would like to take the opportunity to set up tests before much more complex functionality gets included. Consider this to be the first part of what potentially might be multiple posts about writing and organizing testing with cargo.\nIs testing important?🔗\n\nProgram testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but it is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence. \nEdsger W. Dijkstra\n\nI don’t think it is controversial to say I think it is important. Good tests can help protect you from accidental regressions in functionality, and can be an added check on your assumptions, and manual testing. My intention is to write objective unit tests that will replace what I've been doing manually. \nWhy write the tests now? Why not later?🔗\nTo be honest, I want the tests now because I’m looking for ways to use Rust for production code at work, and I need to get a feel for how a Rust codebase matures. As I am exploring Rust, I have come to be impressed with how easy cargo test makes it to write and execute tests.\nIt also will be less work to write test code for a small amount of code I just wrote now, rather than a larger amount of code later. Since it's been my experience that testing will just become reactive. And I get to go back to writing new feature code sooner.\nGetting started with unit testing🔗\nTesting is something that I always seem to go through with print statements, which is better than nothing, but not the most reliable way to be mindful of functionality regression. I would like to try to write more tests, as well as more functional code.\nhttps://doc.rust-lang.org/book/testing.html\nAccording to the official Rust handbook, for unit-style tests, like the what I would like to write, the convention is to create a tests module.\nI’ll cover integration tests in a later post, when I reorganize the project into different files. For now, I’m going to start slow and try to understand the new parts of Rust I get to use.\nIn the same file as the rest of my code, I add my test module with unit tests. I’m going to cover testing the tokenize_command() function.\nmain.rs\n#[cfg(test)]\nmod unittest_tokenize_command {\n    use super::*;\n\n    #[test]\n    #[ignore]\n    fn empty_command() {\n      assert_eq!(\"\", tokenize_command(\"\".to_string()).keyword)\n    }\n\n    #[test]\n    fn test_keyword() {\n      assert_eq!(\"test\", tokenize_command(\"test\".to_string()).keyword)\n    }\n\n    #[test]\n    fn no_arg() {\n      assert_eq!(0, tokenize_command(\"test\".to_string()).args.len())\n    }\n\n    #[test]\n    fn one_arg() {\n      assert_eq!(1, tokenize_command(\"test one\".to_string()).args.len())\n    }\n\n    #[test]\n    fn multi_args() {\n      assert_eq!(3, tokenize_command(\"test one two three\".to_string()).args.len())\n    }\n\n    #[test]\n    #[ignore]\n    fn quotes() {\n      assert_eq!(2, tokenize_command(\"test \\”one two\\” three\".to_string()).args.len())\n    }\n}\n\nBreakdown of test module🔗\nI’ll introduce the new syntax.\nuse super::*🔗\nThe use of use is new to me in Rust. I assume it means I am bringing in the namespace scope from outside to the top-level (instead of using super:: at every function call) \nSince the test module is an inner module, we need to bring the functions from the outside scope into the module’s local scope. We can do this individually, but we can just use * to pull them all in, even though I’m not going to be testing them all right now.\nFor more information about this usage, look at the Crates and Modules page in the Rust documentation.\nAttributes🔗\nThe # lines are called attributes. Attributes are defined by the compiler, and are used for different things. As of Rust 1.17, we currently we cannot create our own attributes. I’ll quickly describe the attributes we use, (but here’s the reference to all of the attributes.\n#[test]🔗\nThe #[test] attribute labels the functions as tests to the rust compiler. This is how cargo test knows what functions to run for tests.\n#[ignore]🔗\nThe #[ignore] attribute tells cargo to skip the test. (However, you can tell cargo to run the ignored tests by running cargo test -- --ignored) I am using this attribute, because as I started writing tests, I realized I hadn’t covered the functionality that would let the tests pass. I don’t want to forget to do this, so I’ll write the test now.\n#[cfg(test)]🔗\nIn #[cfg(test)], we’re using the cfg attribute on the unittest_tokenize_command module. In our usage, the attribute tells the Rust compiler to compile the module only when we are compiling tests, like when we run cargo test.\nRunning the tests🔗\nWe just need to run cargo test.\n$ cargo test\n   Compiling rust-shell v0.1.0 (file:///Users/telant/src/rust-shell)\n    Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.45 secs\n     Running target/debug/deps/rust_shell-cdb27ec22ae15a63\n\nrunning 6 tests\ntest unittest_tokenize_command::empty_command ... ignored\ntest unittest_tokenize_command::quotes ... ignored\ntest unittest_tokenize_command::no_arg ... ok\ntest unittest_tokenize_command::multi_args ... ok\ntest unittest_tokenize_command::test_keyword ... ok\ntest unittest_tokenize_command::one_arg ... ok\n\ntest result: ok. 4 passed; 0 failed; 2 ignored; 0 measured\n\nAnd we see that the all but our ignored tests pass, which is good enough for now!\nIn the next post, I’ll be covering evaluating built-in keywords.\n","description":"Exploring Rust's test suite","id":"https://tjtelan.com/blog/building-a-unix-shell-in-rust-part-3/","path":"/blog/building-a-unix-shell-in-rust-part-3/","title":"Building a Unix-shell in Rust - Part 3"},"https://tjtelan.com/blog/building-a-unix-shell-in-rust-part-4/":{"body":"This is the 4th post in a running series about writing a simple unix shell in the Rust language. \nI suggest you catch up on the previous posts before reading ahead! \n\npart 1\npart 2\npart 3\n\n\nBack to evaluating the parsed command. This time we are going to be implementing built-in functions.\nShell builtins🔗\nLet’s quickly review how a shell works.\nUser is prompted for input. The input is tokenized (we are naively splitting on spaces). The first element of the tokenized input is the keyword, and the rest are the arguments. We execute the keyword with the arguments.\nOur keywords correspond to either a shell function call (a builtin) or an external binary in your executable search path, which we will cover when we look to execute binaries in the next part. (In Bash, you can view this path by looking at the value of the environmental variable PATH. $ echo ${PATH})\nBuiltin keywords are functions that are implemented in the shell codebase. Calls to builtin commands are just local function calls. \nIn Bash, usually you can view what commands are implemented as shell functions with $ man builtins. (And some platforms use external binaries for many common builtins, rather than rely on the shell implementation)\nSome common builtins, which we will implement are:\n\necho\nhistory\ncd\npwd\n\nMy initial strategy🔗\nI’m going to keep my strategy simple. When I input a command, I want to run the builtin command. If my input is not a builtin, then let’s throw an error saying the command isn’t found. This will set us up for when we execute binaries,.\nThe first thing we want to do when we process the command is evaluate if it is a builtin. If it is, we want to pass arguments to the builtin function. \nI’m scratching my head a little bit about how to represent the mapping of a keyword to a function in an idiomatic way.\nI’ve found the HashMap module, which is part of the standard collection library, but I’m looking to see if I can use something else that doesn’t require importing a library. I think what I want is an enum and I can pattern match to call builtin functions.\nAfter a little bit of thought, I wondered if I could parse the string into the enum? My google-ing informs me that to accomplish this, I need to implement the fromStr trait. \nenum Builtin {\n  Echo,\n  History,\n  Cd,\n  Pwd\n}\n\nimpl FromStr for Builtin {\n  type Err = ();\n  fn from_str(s : &amp;str) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, Self::Err&gt; {\n    match s {\n      \"echo\" =&gt; Ok(Builtin::Echo),\n      \"history\" =&gt; Ok(Builtin::History),\n      \"cd\" =&gt; Ok(Builtin::Cd),\n      \"pwd\" =&gt; Ok(Builtin::Pwd),\n      _ =&gt; Err(()),\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThis is how I use the enum to call the function if it is a builtin\nfn process_command(c : Command) -&gt; i32 {\n  match Builtin::from_str(&amp;c.keyword) {\n    Ok(Builtin::Echo) =&gt; builtin_echo(&amp;c.args),\n    Ok(Builtin::History) =&gt; builtin_history(&amp;c.args),\n    Ok(Builtin::Cd) =&gt; builtin_cd(&amp;c.args),\n    Ok(Builtin::Pwd) =&gt; builtin_pwd(&amp;c.args),\n    _ =&gt; {\n        println!(\"{}: command not found\", &amp;c.keyword);\n        1\n    },\n  }\n}\n\nHere’s an example of one of the builtins. (I’m only going to show one with functionality, because I’m going to implement the rest later)\nI chose to implement echo because it is very easy to verify. \nfn builtin_echo(args : &amp;Vec&lt;String&gt;) -&gt; i32 {\n  println!(\"{}\", args.join(\" \"));\n  0\n}\n\nThe number I'm returning signal that the command is done executing and represent the exit code of the command. 0 is conventionally a successful call, and anything else is an error. \nAnd here we are in action:\n$ cargo run\n    Finished debug [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs\n     Running `target/debug/rust-shell`\n% echo test test test\nDEBUG: Raw input: \"echo test test test\\n\"\nDEBUG: Split input: [\"echo\", \"test\", \"test\", \"test\"]\nDEBUG: keyword : \"echo\"\nDEBUG: args : [\"test\", \"test\", \"test\"]\ntest test test\nDEBUG: Exit code : 0\n% not_a_real_command lkfjdslf lkjfwe\nDEBUG: Raw input: \"not_a_real_command lkfjdslf lkjfwe\\n\"\nDEBUG: Split input: [\"not_a_real_command\", \"lkfjdslf\", \"lkjfwe\"]\nDEBUG: keyword : \"not_a_real_command\"\nDEBUG: args : [\"lkfjdslf\", \"lkjfwe\"]\nnot_a_real_command: command not found\nDEBUG: Exit code : 1\n\nI think I’m going to use this break to do some minor cleanup, write tests, and start using the rust logging mechanisms, such as the log crate.

Like all tech development trends, everyone wants it, but everyone also has their own ideas about the kind of problems it will solve. This is a precarious situation, because a lot of people aren’t wrong. But they are unaware that their version of the truth is so narrow that they end up missing the big picture.\nIn this post, I’ll discuss DevOps at a high level by addressing: \n\nWhat is (and what isn’t) DevOps\nHow DevOps differs from the “normal” development process you may already have\nHow practicing DevOps can reduce time and money required for development and operations\nHow nurturing a DevOps culture will increase the quality of life for everyone working on your product\n\nThere are many more topics to discuss, but we must stay focused! This should lay the foundation to allow for constructive conversation about how DevOps works in your organization. \nWho should read this post?🔗\nThis post is primarily intended for people who need to know the purpose of DevOps because they’re managing a team or hiring for a DevOps skill set. You also might find it helpful if you’re just wondering what DevOps is all about as a developer, operator, student, or in a related, non-technical role.\nConventions and Definitions🔗\nLet’s start with some definitions and conventions so we’re on the same page.\nEnvironment or space may be used interchangeably. It refers to the location where code is being executed. A laptop or workstation are examples of environments that we can physically touch. But Kubernetes, or “the cloud” are examples of more abstract environments.\nDevelopment environment will refer to any environment that is primarily used by a single person for the purposes of writing code, such as a laptop or a workstation.\nProduction environment will refer to any environment that is shared, regardless of whether external customers are using it. An internally used environment used only for testing purposes is a production environment. Big differences between a development environment and a production environment may be complexity or scale at which components are deployed. As well as the amount of targeted automation to perform changes such as deployment or collection of analytics. \nDevelopment (Dev) is a phase and a team we associate with writing code. Specifically, it refers to code that has not yet been released officially to a wider audience. When a project is in development, there is an implication that it may not yet be stable. The people who do the code writing are called Developers, or Dev.\nOperations (Ops) is a phase and a team we associate with building and maintaining the environment(s) used for running code from Development, as well as infrastructure used to support the running code. The people who run code may also be Developers, but they are also commonly known as Operators, Ops, SysAdmins, SREs, Production Engineers, and increasingly (and incorrectly) as DevOps Engineers.\nDevOps is the art of joining principles from traditional software Development and Operations so both can work better together. DevOps is not a phase of development, nor is it a role, despite the emergence of DevOps engineering roles or teams. It is an organization’s professional culture, and emotional intelligence for working together as a single team. The purpose of DevOps is managing expected behavior of the product in production with respect to constant “change of state” (we’ll talk about that soon).\nThe problem DevOps solves🔗\nAn industry trope is the antagonistic rivalry about whose role, Dev or Ops, is more important. But it doesn’t need to be a battle. DevOps is a culture or method of interaction between Dev and Ops and a direct result is shortened feedback loops between writing code (development) and running code (operations). \nAdmittedly, “DevOps” is a more complex concept when compared to Dev or Ops, which muddies an otherwise straightforward conversation because the actual tasks of practicing DevOps are not one-size-fits all.\nSoftware is rarely a single moving piece. The benefit is the flexibility to incrementally change the state of any single piece. The “change of state” refers to updates to code or the supporting infrastructure, and effectively communicating those changes to the people involved. As a system grows in complexity, it takes some effort to make changes without disrupting other pieces.\nDevOps, as a practice, is about managing the changes to those moving pieces in an organized and intentional manner. An example of where DevOps builds this bridge is deploying to production. Thin encourages releasing and running code in a way that Devs and Ops can anticipate each other’s changes, at a high rate. These procedures are preferably automated, for speed and consistency.\nChange the job title on your reqs: DevOps is not a role!🔗\nUnfortunately, DevOps is increasingly used as a catch-all for all engineering tasks that do not have an owner. The result is that it starts to lose any specific meaning.\nA recent (and regrettable) trend in job postings is to rebrand SysAdmin or Operations roles into “DevOps engineer” roles. This makes it more difficult for companies and job-seekers alike to make a good match.\nCase in point: coding is often listed as a requirement for a “DevOps Engineer” role, but if that role is actually an operations role, there will be few opportunities to write code. This means that new hires joining with the expectation that their role includes coding will feel misled, and turnover will be increased.\nWhat does a solution look like?🔗\nSo what is DevOps if not a role? Let’s describe practicing DevOps through the actions of the members of the technical organization.\nDevOps-enabled Dev vs Pure Development🔗\nUnlike pure development, DevOps is primarily about improving processes and analytics capabilities to remove friction from developers’ workflows, outside of writing code. It is not about product functionality or quality of the product code. For example, Devs define the terms of success or failure of the behavior of their code in production. But thanks to DevOps practices, they can analyze that data to inform their next actions. \nDevs in a DevOps practice have a shorter onboarding process as well. Common tasks such as software requirements for build code and deploying code are documented through automation that is kept up to date. With this, new devs can focus on the codebase on day one, not spending all day reading documentation.\nDevOps-enabled Ops vs Pure Operations🔗\nUnlike pure operations, DevOps is proactive about observing how running code is behaving from within the code rather than only observing results. The purpose is to maximize the value of human time by only requiring a person to look into a problem if existing automated strategies fail to resolve it.\nAdditionally, the introduction of Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (or Deployment) pipeline (aka CI/CD) is an important collection of automation shared between Devs and Ops. The Devs know how to push code for build for the CI, and the Ops know how to pull build artifacts for deployment. \nDevOps-enabled management🔗\nThere is a lot to be said about DevOps-enabled management, but I will keep it brief (but stay tuned, this will be the topic of a future post). For now, I will be focusing on communication, quality of life of your employees, and a short aside on saving money on cloud operational expenditure.\nAs a product manager, DevOps directly serves the priorities and product roadmap, as they will be naturally driven from the analytics of your production environments. More objective discussion can be had with your developers and operators when you can provide more specific details and requirements to what is motivating your decision making as a manager. Data about feature usage or responsiveness can more easily be measured and placed onto a dashboard if the metrics to be tracked are known during development, rather than after a feature is complete. This production data can help facilitate discussions with your stakeholders.\nAs a hiring manager, DevOps enables you to be more specific about what it is you are looking for in job applicants. If you’re looking for a candidate with broad skills, you can justify why with actual functions that need served. Otherwise, you can also be much more specific with need for specialized roles since the functions of your direct reports feed into the quality of your analytics. \nLastly, if you operate in cloud infrastructure such as AWS or Azure, your DevOps practice should condition you to analyze your compute usage for ways to save money. It can show you when you may be able to shut down compute resources for the night to save costs on guaranteed idle time that you would otherwise be paying for. Automation can automatically turn them back on for the work day if needed by devs, but otherwise, you may find that these resources are often unintentionally abandoned by devs.\nConclusion🔗\nIf you are a manager, how do you start a DevOps practice? You start by consistently being data-driven through requests for data from your employees. Show them how the data influences your decision making. The consistency of your requests ought to naturally lead to automation of data collection.\nRemember that DevOps is more than operations. It is a professional workplace culture that starts with management through commitment to improve communication. \nTo do both drive and support this, management must be very specific about what information they need from their product, then align their processes to reinforce these needs. Realize that this kind of organization of processes is optimal. The perceived constraints your employees experience provides very clear expectations for team success while allowing individual opportunity to be creative and fulfilled without setting expectations that it is any individual person’s responsibility.\nDevOps is a practice that produces solutions that scale to the needs of the organization and humanizes the people who create solutions. It allows people to specialize their craft while providing a structure to let them trust that the rest of their surroundings (infrastructure) will be ready to accept any of their new creations.\n","description":"This is the first of a series about helping your organization embrace DevOps","id":"https://tjtelan.com/blog/devops-helps-you-be-a-better-leader/","path":"/blog/devops-helps-you-be-a-better-leader/","title":"DevOps Helps you be a Better Leader"},"https://tjtelan.com/blog/devops-zero-sum/":{"body":"Link to the original discussion on Dev.to\n\nSome of my intention is to lean into the ambiguity of the definition of DevOps.\nIn general, when automation is created and introduced into an organization for the purposes of \"progress\" for a wide audience, is this improvement gained at the expense of an individual or a team?\n\nHere's a made up example. Automatic alerts in a production environment of a web app for a small US company's online order form.\nThe primary customer live in US timezones. The assumed culture is that outages are to be avoided. 24/7 uptime.\nBefore alerting was introduced in this org, outages in production might not be known until traditional work hours when more complex workflows.\nAfter alerting was introduced, the possibility of non-work hour wake up calls from alerts increased significantly. On-call/event-based compensation might balance the fairness to the person responsible, but that's a monetary cost paid from the org to offset a forced work-life cost.\nIn my opinion, the introduction of automation led to compromise by the individual, with practically no benefit to the business to make no change.\n","description":"Discussion about whether DevOps culture requires winners and losers","id":"https://tjtelan.com/blog/devops-zero-sum/","path":"/blog/devops-zero-sum/","title":"Is DevOps Automation a zero-sum game?"},"https://tjtelan.com/blog/end-of-month-summary/":{"body":"This is the first of what will be a series of end of month summaries. Structure won’t always be the same. I’m figuring things out as I go.\nProfessional🔗\nContinuing efforts from December into January, I got to sharpen my design skills. Long story short, we were contracting with a couple of UX designers who were producing wireframes, our engagement was ending. But the team benefitted a lot from having something visual to facilitate communicating between the business or developers. \nI really liked it. It was a nice change from writing Rust code, and I felt that the effort was very impactful. I don’t think I’ll be going full time into doing any proper UX design, but this reinforced how I feel about the importance of communicating effectively in this software development environment.\nAs someone who works from home, asynchronous, written communication (with or without visual aid) is more impactful than only communicating face to face. Knowing how to write code has been way less important for me than being capable of expressing ideas or strategy in plain language.\nPersonal🔗\nEvery January, my partner and I participate in vegan January (aka Veganuary). I like the contrast from the family and food heavy holidays, and the routine of starting every year with this self-imposed restriction. \nThis is the 7th year we’ve done it, and for the most part it is a non-event. We’re decent home cooks and already eat a mostly plant-based diet, (but I did miss eating eggs for breakfast). As a highlight, I’ve been learning to cook more Filipino food, and most successful experiment was the tofu + potato adobo.\n\nMy theme for 2023 is improving work-life balance. I’ve been working from home since 2020, and I live with unbalance more towards work. It was already unsustainable, so the intent is taking steps to correct it.\nWith inspiration from CGP Grey’s Spaceship You and the intro ritual from every Mr. Rogers Neighborhood episodes I’ve seen, I started creating physical cues between my work-space and the rest of the house.\nImprovements:\n\nWork must be at my desk (with some exceptions for the winter, because my office is in my cold basement), and I have dedicated “work glasses”.\nI have a proper “hobby space” in my garage that doesn’t primarily require sitting at a keyboard and monitor. This required a larger cleaning effort, which alone has improved my quality of life.\nI have dedicated “life glasses”. No day-job work wearing these glasses. No exceptions!\n\nCommunity🔗\nA goal is to participate more at my local makerspace. This month I attended a couple events for learning how to use a sewing machine, an embroidery machine, and learning how to use Unity for game making.\nIt kind of feels bad to not immediately have these skills click. A quote from Adventure Time gives me comfort. “Sucking is the first step to being good at something”. My hope for writing this experience down is to create a little accountability to myself to not quit.\n","description":"Quick summary for January 2023","id":"https://tjtelan.com/blog/end-of-month-summary/","path":"/blog/end-of-month-summary/","title":"January 2023 recap"},"https://tjtelan.com/blog/first-time-hacktoberfest-2020/":{"body":"So... what is Hacktoberfest?🔗\nDigital Ocean’s Hacktoberfest is a month-long event over the month of October aimed at generating an increase of contributions to open source projects. Participants are asked to open PRs against public repositories in Github with “positive contributions”. Swag is offered to the first 70k participants to open 4 qualified PRs.\n\n        A typical hacker\n\nAnd… how is it going?🔗\nI have mixed opinions that honestly, skew negatively. But I feel like I’m more charitable about my feedback than what I've seen on the internet. I’m not intending to drag Hacktoberfest but I’d like to see improvement.\n2020 is my first year participating in Hacktoberfest. I’ve already been contributing more to the open source community over the last few years. Particularly for the Rust programming language. I set out to use this event as an excuse to help the Rust community out.\nPositives:🔗\nThe feeling of a community effort to contribute to Open Source🔗\n\n        A typical open source PR\n\nContributions to open source can happen at any time. I think it’s a nice idea to have a time where people who use open source software are encouraged to contribute meaningfully. Especially for anyone who may feel a bit of intimidation to do so. I’m sure a T-shirt and some stickers can feel very validating to someone who was just using open source before, and now they have some evidence that they contributed too.\nDiscovering smaller projects🔗\n\n        Bob Ross had amazing commit messages\n\nThis was a great opportunity to explore Github for projects that don’t require a lot of experience or commitment in order to help a maintainer out. The repos I offered code to were all small Rust projects that were doing some practical things. It was fun, and I put some effort into what I wrote in addition to having good interactions with the maintainers.\nNegatives:🔗\nThis year’s Hot-fix to the rules and the lack of follow-up communication🔗\n\n        Talk to your community\n\nI feel like the communication around the event is not being managed well. Very reactive, and not effective at spreading the word.\nA few days after the start of the event, there was a significant change in the rules. I only happened to learn about it through the grapevine, as opposed to from Digital Ocean or through the Hacktoberfest front page or profile pages. Rules feel like they are inconsistently applied, and it feels unwelcoming.\n\nWhere this change affected me is their change of minimum review times, and probably the validity of my contributions. But I’m confused about what is supposed to apply to me since I had created all my PRs in the first 3 days.\nWhat makes this more confusing is the conflicting information within the Hacktoberfest FAQ.\nFor example, this is likely some old information about the review time of PRs. States 7 days.\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        From FAQ. Review time of 7 days\n\nLater in the same FAQ it says it’s been updated to 14 days. But only those before October 3, 2020 @ 12:00 UTC\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        Also from FAQ. Review time of 14 days\n\nAll 4 PRs were made before this rule change was stated to go into effect (Oct 3 @ 12:00 UTC). The latest being Oct 3 @ 6:26 UTC.\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        4 PRs. All earlier than Oct 3 @ 12:00 UTC\n\nChanges to the rules could have been communicated somewhere on the profile page in the legend, but were not. Or through email, like the message I received when I made my first PR.\nI just noticed all my maturation times jump from about a week to about 2 weeks. 3 of these were PRs that were already merged too.\nAnd I’m more annoyed and slightly unmotivated to continue in the event.\n(But tbh, rather than feel angry, I’m psyched that I got a few PRs merged so quickly!)\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        Missed opportunity to communicate that this duration has been updated from 7 to 14 days.\n\nFeeling like corporate-sponsored projects are taking advantage of free labor🔗\nI think that the core intention of Hacktoberfest is well meaning. But I'm seeing some non-trivial work in big projects labeled for Hacktoberfest.\nI’m not personally driven by the swag of a free T-shirt. I just want to help the Rust community and level up my skills while I'm at it. But I feel weird sitting near loud, negative opinions that I partially agree with. (Although my feelings are a lot more charitable and less intense)\nBefore the silent rule changes, the premise of projects that must opt-out really placed a huge burden on the maintainers of small projects.\n\n        A typical maintainer during Hacktoberfest\n\nBut I’m mostly in my raw feelings, because I feel like the focused energy of the open source community is being taken advantage of by bigger corporate entities for a T-shirt. They are all on the bandwagon to use free energy from eager and inexperienced developers to contribute to their big name-brand projects even though they have their own funding for development.\nBut... will I participate next year?🔗\n\n        \n\nHard to say at this moment, but what incentive do I have? I can contribute any time to small projects, and I most likely will. I have to thank Digital Ocean for helping me realize that.\nThe spirit to drive help to small projects is one of my favorite parts of open source, and I think that Hacktoberfest probably started out with that ethos before their audience made it about T-shirts and stickers.\nI don’t like the gamified feeling, and maybe that makes this event not for me. The new rule changes will very much change the feel of participation. Probably for the better, since it is opt-in.\n\nAs I continue to dig into the changes, it appears that there was a tweet made prior to the changes, but from my perspective, if you didn’t use Twitter and follow @hacktoberfest, you’d continue to be lost to the change.\nThis message appears on their site, but I only got to it through the PR. I don't know how else I would have found it because it isn't on the front page or anywhere I'd easily find.\nOn one account, I've been told that an email was sent out to highlight rule changes. Pretty late after the fact, but I guess better than never. I cannot confirm this myself, since at the time of this writing, I haven't received any email regarding rule changes.\n\nDepending on how the changes affect the mood and the outcome of this year's event, I could probably warm up to the idea of 2021. Either way, I'll still be opening PRs against something.\nI'll give credit where it is due to the Hacktoberfest team for responding to abusive participants. BUT I don’t appreciate rules being changed without care to communicate them effectively. I expect better communication from a worldwide event. Please learn from this!\n\nAnyway, if you've made it this far, don't wait for October to contribute to open source! \n","description":"My experience and opinion on my first Hacktoberfest in 2020","id":"https://tjtelan.com/blog/first-time-hacktoberfest-2020/","path":"/blog/first-time-hacktoberfest-2020/","title":"A first-timer's perspective to Digital Ocean's Hacktoberfest 2020"},"https://tjtelan.com/blog/github-actions-push-vs-pr-workflow/":{"body":"My experience using Github Actions for CI/CD as a solo contributor🔗\nI am using Github Actions to build and deploy my website when I push.

This workflow is simple but only works because I am the only contributor.\nGithub Actions for CI/CD with Pull Request🔗\nIt is a good practice to run sanity checks on pull requests prior to merging. How would that be accomplished with Github Actions?\nIt turns out that you can do this but you need to be very intentional with how your jobs are configured.\nIn my workflow, I am designating a main branch main that will run full CI/CD. Build, test and deploy. And for any other branch, just build and test.\nI’ll share my example Github Actions workflow file, then I’ll provide a template that you can modify and use for your own purposes.\nMy example Github Actions workflow🔗\nHere’s my site’s current workflow file for Github Actions.

I use the actions/checkout@main marketplace action to check my code out, and I use my fork of an action for Zola called tjtelan/zola-deploy-action@main. I have an environment variable BUILD_ONLY set to true which results in building my site but not deploying it.\n\nbuild_and_deploy job\n  build_and_deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'\n    steps:\n      - name: 'Checkout'\n        uses: actions/checkout@main\n      - name: 'Build and deploy'\n        uses: tjtelan/zola-deploy-action@main\n        env:\n          PAGES_BRANCH: gh-pages \n          BUILD_DIR: .\n          TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}\n\n\nThis job also uses the ubuntu-latest github hosted runner as my environment.\nI do a similar check for the git ref via the github.ref key. This time I am looking for the working branch to be main\nLastly are my steps. Same as the previous job, but I am configuring tjtelan/zola-deploy-action@main differently. Rather than setting BUILD_ONLY, I am defining PAGES_BRANCH to gh-pages, which is where I want to deploy my site code after build.\n\nLast words on job differences🔗\nThe only differences are the branch check via github.ref, and the specifics of steps. I happen to be using my own Github Action tjtelan/zola-deploy-action but your steps could consist of anything you want to do differently between pull requests and push to your “special” branch.\nGithub Actions template🔗\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - main\n  pull_request:\njobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    if: github.ref != 'refs/heads/main\n    steps:\n      - name: 'Checkout'\n        uses: actions/checkout@main\n  build_and_deploy:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main\n    steps:\n      - name: 'Checkout'\n        uses: actions/checkout@main\n\nHere’s a template that you can use for your own push vs PR workflows.

Your branch protections, in-progress PRs, and drafts can migrate safely. Follow this simple checklist to confidently make these changes and create a seamless experience for yourself and your developer community.\nIntroduction🔗\nWhat’s in a (branch) name?🔗\nIf you have existing git repos at Github (or any other git hosting platform), you probably have a branch in your repo named master. Starting October 1st, 2020, Github will officially stop their practice of naming the first branch of new repositories master. Instead, the name main will be used from now on. \nThe usage of master is unfortunately deeply ingrained into those who learned how to use git and developed muscle memory. But did you know that Git (the tool) has no technical requirement that you use master as your default branch name? However, because it is the first branch created when you run git init, it’s often the default used. As a result, hosting platforms such as Github or continuous integration systems like Jenkins or TravisCI create workflows that typically use these defaults as release branches.\nCan’t I just rename master to main?🔗\nAutomation and development workflows will make renaming master require more effort than just following the first Stack Overflow answer you can find to answer the question. \nIn Github’s official statement, they suggest waiting until later in the year to perform this switch yourself if your repo has any of the following conditions:\n\nOpen pull requests need to be retargeted to the new branch\nDraft releases need to be retargeted to the new branch\nBranch protection policies need to be transferred to the new branch\n\nDon’t want to wait? While this won’t be as simple as just renaming your branches, you can still perform this switch on your personal or organization’s repos by modifying branch protections, PRs, and draft releases. Follow along to find out how.\nMigration strategy🔗\nI will walk through this migration, step-by-step. Feel free to skip the optional steps if they do not apply to your situation. Note that your new default branch name does not have to be called main – this is just Github’s new default and what I will be using in this example (you can call your new branch steve, for all I care).\nThis guide is Github-focused, but you should still be able to follow along for other scenarios – these concepts are not exclusive to Github.\nHere are the high-level steps we’ll go through:\n\nCommunicate upcoming changes to collaborators\nMirror/copy master branch to main branch\n(Optional) Modify any CI that specifically triggers on master to use main\n(Optional) Duplicate branch protections from master, and apply them to main.\n(Optional) Modify draft releases to target main\n(Optional) Modify open pull requests to retarget to main\nSet the default branch to main\nDelete master branch from local clone\nDelete master branch in remote repo\n\n1. Communicate upcoming changes to collaborators🔗\nThis is a very important step!\nIf your codebase has a significant amount of active development and you plan to rename master, consider the subtle costs and impacts to the workflow. Other developers or operators will need to take action!\nThe name of a branch has no bearing on how git functions at a technical level. However, the name of a branch can have high importance because of organizational norms of how development and operations are organized. Not communicating changes to your collaborators about renaming your default branch can cause unnecessary confusion when pushing code and loss of trust.\nYou can’t assume that everyone knows enough about git to make the necessary changes to their workflow to participate. (In which case, you can share this guide!)\n2. Mirror/copy master branch to main branch🔗\nTo start the migration, we want to branch off master into a local branch named main and push main to remote.\nWe’ll work from a fresh clone (assuming our default branch is master):\n$ git clone &lt;url&gt;\n$ cd &lt;repo&gt; \n\nIn the new clone, we will create our new branch, main, and push it to Github.\n$ git checkout -b main\nSwitched to a new branch 'main'\n\n$ git push -u origin main\nTotal 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\nremote:\nremote: Create a pull request for 'main' on GitHub by visiting:\nremote:  \thttps://github.com/tjtelan/example-repo/pull/new/main\nremote:\nTo github.com:tjtelan/example-repo.git\n * [new branch]  \tmain -&gt; main\nBranch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.\n\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        \n\nWith the new branch pushed, we can now start making the platform changes w/ respect to the main branch.\n3. Modify any CI that specifically triggers on master to use main🔗\nThis step is optional. You can skip it if you don’t have any continuous integration (CI).\nCI is often triggered on events for specific branches. I’ll go over an example of updating CI workflow using Github Actions.\nChange your trigger branches🔗\nIf your CI is triggered on events to your master branch, you’ll obviously need to change that to main for Actions to react to events on the main branch.\n[...]\non:\n  push:\n\tbranches: [ main ]\n  pull_request:\n\tbranches: [ main ]\n[...]\n\nOr within your jobs:\n[...]\njobs:\n  build:\n\truns-on: ubuntu-latest\n\tif: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'\n\tsteps:\n[...]\n\nUpdate any plugins referencing master🔗\nFor example, if you happen to be using any of Github’s official plugins, such as actions/checkout, \nChange your Github Actions to act on main instead of master\n\tsteps:\n  \t- name: 'Checkout'\n    \tuses: actions/checkout@main\n\n(or use a tag instead of a branch)\n\tsteps:\n  \t- name: 'Checkout'\n    \tuses: actions/checkout@v2\n\nIf you’re using other plugins, you will need to check the repo of those plugins to verify if the author has migrated their master branch to main.\n4. Duplicate branch protections from master, and apply them to main🔗\nThis step is optional if you don’t have any branch protection rules.\nhttps://github.com/&lt;account&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/settings/branches\nYou’ll need to create a new branch protection rule:\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        \n\nYou’ll probably need to have another window open with the master branch rules open so it’s easier to copy over… At least I did.\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        \n\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        Don't delete the master branch protection rules before you're ready to delete the branch altogeher\n\nAfter you’re done with all the branch migration, you can delete the branch protection rules for the master branch. There’s no urgency to do it immediately, but you will need to do this before completing the transition to main (Github won’t let you delete a branch that still has active protection rules.)\n5. Modify draft releases to target main🔗\nThis step is optional if you don’t have any draft releases currently targeting master.\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        \n\nIn your repo Releases, select Edit on the draft:\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        \n\nIn the target dropdown, change the branch to main -- and then Save draft. That’s all there is to it!\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        \n\n6. Modify open pull requests to retarget to main🔗\nThis step is optional. You can skip this step if you don’t have existing PRs targeting master.\nSo you have existing PRs against master?\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        \n\nThis is an easy fix! You can just edit the PR to use your new branch as the base branch.\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        \n\nAnd retarget the base branch to main\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        \n\nAnd then confirm changing the base branch.\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        \n\n7. Set the default branch to main🔗\nOnce you’ve got the main branch pushed up to Github, it is easy to set main to be the new default branch.\nhttps://github.com/&lt;account&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/settings/branches\nIn your repository settings, click the drop-down menu, and select main.\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        \n\nClick Update.\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        \n\nClick I understand, update the default branch\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        \n\nIf your organization needs more time to migrate away from master, you can pause after this step. Commits will need to flow into both main and master until it has been fully transitioned. This may be briefly inconvenient, but it will allow processes to continue until master can be deprecated.\n8. Delete master branch in remote repo🔗\nYou have two options to delete the master branch.\nThrough the web browser🔗\nOn the code tab, click the branch selection drop-down and click the View all branches link\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        \n\nNote: If you had branch protection rules for master, you will need to delete them prior to this step. Otherwise Github will prevent the branch from being deleted.\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        The master branch cannot be deleted because of its branch protection rules\n\nAt the branch listing, find one of the rows with master listed, and click the trash icon on the right.\nWarning! There is no additional prompt after clicking this icon. But you have the option to restore the branch while you are still on the page. However, if you’ve made it this far, deleting it is probably what you want\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        Deleting the master branch protection rules\n\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        The master branch can now be deleted\n\nThrough the cli🔗\n$ git push --delete -u origin master\nTo github.com:tjtelan/example-repo.git\n - [deleted]     \tmaster\n\n9. Delete master branch from local clone🔗\n$ git branch -D master\n\n\nConclusion🔗\nA branch by any other name would still merge as clean🔗\nThe names of the branches don’t have any bearing on the functionality of git. But the practice of using offensive terminology to describe defaults or importance needs to end. Plus, main as an initial branch name is a better descriptive label for how the branch is conventionally used.\nIf you and your collaborators are able to cease the usage of master as your default branch without needing to rely on Github, your git host provider, or your operations team, I encourage you to do it.\nThe git project will soon stop using master as the first branch created by git init. So your organization should prioritize this migration as well as making the necessary changes in your tooling and automation sooner rather than later.\n","description":"Checklist to migrate your git repository’s primary branch from master to main","id":"https://tjtelan.com/blog/github-rename-your-default-branch/","path":"/blog/github-rename-your-default-branch/","title":"9 steps to rename your default Github branch safely"},"https://tjtelan.com/blog/gnome-xmonad-lucid/":{"body":"I just got started using tiling window managers because I find that I am a little more productive when I don't use the mouse.

I had a major loss in the family, and I didn’t really have the energy to create or share anything this year. I’m feeling ready to restart my plans again. But I’m feeling a little boxed in by restrictions of my own creation, and so I’m going to remove them. Next year will be dedicated to experimenting with the projects and content I work on.\nI was reminded that I create publicly because I don’t see or hear people like me in my spaces. The intent behind why I continue to post is to improve my communication and story telling skills. Creating content forces me to better understand what I’m talking about. I’m glad it also supporting others, leading to a collectively better understanding of a topic.\nBoundaries on content are being established for 2023. I’ll still write about Rust or DevOps stuff (and a couple posts are in in progress too). I’m not committing to complete them in any specific timeframe, however. They are lower priority, so I can explore ideas outside of my day job. This is to reinforce stricter boundaries with efforts and concepts related to actively solving problems in my day job. Preferably, Day job-type content will be supported during day job hours.\nThere will be more update-type posts to document my progress on various topics in the short-term. I’m hoping to post more regularly in exchange of spending less effort planning and editing content. Hopefully setting the quality bar expectations lower will take a lot of the pressure off of completing something before posting, because this is supposed to be fun for me. Not an extension for work.\nI don’t know how to end this so I’ll just keep it simple. Ranges of topics I write about will expand to outside of tech (but may be adjacent, occasionally). Plans will also include more than written content, as I’m trying to improve my video editing skills too.\nHere’s to the new year, 2023.

But I encourage you to follow along, as I will narrate changes while I make them.\nWhat are we writing?🔗\nIn this example, I will be writing a remote command-line server/client.\nThe client will take in a command line command and send it to the server who will execute the command and send back the contents of standard out.\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        Diagram of the interaction we'll be working with\n\nFor simplicity sake, this example will wait for the execution to complete on the server side before returning output.

For demonstrative and educational purposes only!\nWriting the command line interface🔗\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        \n\nThe command line interface is the foundation that will allow us to package our gRPC server and client into the same binary. We’re going to start our new crate with the CLI first.\n$ cargo new cli-grpc-tonic-blocking\n    Created binary (application) `cli-grpc-tonic-blocking` package\n$ cd cli-grpc-tonic-blocking\n\nWe will use a crate called StructOpt. StructOpt utilizes the Clap crate which is a powerful command line parser.

A command has an executable name and optionally also arguments.\n$ cargo run -- &lt;executable&gt; [args]\n\nOr to illustrate with how one would use this command w/o cargo if it were named remotecli:\n$ remotecli run &lt;executable&gt; [args]\n\nOptional arguments for the client🔗\nJust like how our server will have a default listening address and port, our client will assume to connect to the default address. We just want to offer the user the option to connect to a different server.\nWe will provide the option for the server address in a flag --server-addr\nThe CLI code so far🔗\nI’m going to break down the current main.rs into their structs, enums and functions to describe how StructOpt is utilized.\nSkip down to the next section All together if you want to review this file in a single code block.\nIn parts🔗\nApplicationArguments🔗\n// This is the main arguments structure that we'll parse from\n#[derive(StructOpt, Debug)]\n#[structopt(name = \"remotecli\")]\nstruct ApplicationArguments {\n   #[structopt(flatten)]\n   pub subcommand: SubCommand,\n}\n\n\n\nLike the comment says, this will be the main struct that you work with to parse args from the user input. \n\n\nWe use derive(StructOpt) on this struct to let the compiler know to generate the command line parser.\n\n\nThe structopt(name) attribute is reflected in the generated CLI help. Rust will use this name instead of the name of the crate, which again is cli-grpc-tonic-blocking. It is purely cosmetic.\n\n\nThe structopt(flatten) attribute is used on the ApplicationArguments struct field. The result effectively replaces this field with the contents of the SubCommand type, which we’ll get to next. \n\n\nIf we didn’t use flatten, then the user would need to use the CLI like this:\n## No subcommand flattening\n\n$ remotecli subcommand &lt;subcommand&gt; … \n\nBut with the flattening we get a simplified form without the subcommand literal.\n## With subcommand flattening\n\n$ remotecli &lt;subcommand&gt; ...\n\nThe reason for this pattern is to allow grouping of the subcommands into a type that we can pattern match on, which is nice for the developer. But at the same time we keep the CLI hierarchy minimal for the user.\nSubCommand🔗\n// These are the only valid values for our subcommands\n#[derive(Debug, StructOpt)]\npub enum SubCommand {\n   /// Start the remote command gRPC server\n   #[structopt(name = \"server\")]\n   StartServer(ServerOptions),\n   /// Send a remote command to the gRPC server\n   #[structopt(setting = structopt::clap::AppSettings::TrailingVarArg)]\n   Run(RemoteCommandOptions),\n}\n\n\n\nWe’re working with an enum this time. But again, the most important part is the derive(StructOpt) attribute.\n\n\nThe reason to use an enum is to provide some development comfort. Each field in the enum takes in a struct where additional parsing occurs in the event that the subcommand is chosen. But this pattern enables us to not mix that up within this enum and make the code unfocused, and hard to read.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second most important detail is to notice the comments with 3 slashes ///.\n\n\nThese are doc comments, and their placement is intentional. Rust will use these comments in the generated help command. The 2 slash comments are notes just for you, the developer, and are not seen by the user.\n\n\n\n\nFor the first subcommand, admittedly I named this field StartServer so I could show off using the structopt(name) attribute.\n\nWithout the attribute, the user would experience the subcommand transformed by default into the “kebab-case” form start-command. With the name defined on the StartServer field, we tell Rust that we want the user to use server instead.\n(You can configure this behavior with the structopt(rename_all) attribute. I won’t be covering that. Read more about rename_all in the docs)\n\nThe second subcommand Run... you’ll have to forgive my 👋hand waving👋.\n\n\nRemember that StructOpt is built on top of the Clap crate.\n\n\nClap is quite flexible, but I thought it was much harder to use. StructOpt offers the ability to pass configuration to Clap and we’re setting a configuration setting w/ respect to the parsing behavior for only this subcommand.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to pass a full command from the client to the server. But we don’t necessarily know how long that command will be and we don’t want the full command to be parsed.\n\n\nThe technical description for this kind of CLI parameter is a “Variable-length Argument” or a VarArg in this case. It is a hint for how to parse the last argument so you don’t need to define an end length -- it just trails off.\n\n\nWe are configuring the Run subcommand to tell Rust that this uses a VarArg. See the Clap docs for more info about this and other AppSettings.\n\n\nServerOptions🔗\n// These are the options used by the `server` subcommand\n#[derive(Debug, StructOpt)]\npub struct ServerOptions {\n   /// The address of the server that will run commands.\n   #[structopt(long, default_value = \"127.0.0.1:50051\")]\n   pub server_listen_addr: String,\n}\n\n\n\nOur server subcommand has a single configurable option.\n\n\nThe structopt(long) attribute specifies that this is an option that the user will specify with the double-hyphen pattern with the name of the option, which will be in kebab-case by default. Therefore the user would use this as --server-listen-addr.\n\n\nstructopt(default_value) is hopefully self-explanatory enough. If the user doesn’t override, the default value will be used. The default value type is a string slice &amp;str, but structopt is converting it into a String by default.\n\n\nRemoteCommandOptions🔗\n// These are the options used by the `run` subcommand\n#[derive(Debug, StructOpt)]\npub struct RemoteCommandOptions {\n   /// The address of the server that will run commands.\n   #[structopt(long = \"server\", default_value = \"http://127.0.0.1:50051\")]\n   pub server_addr: String,\n   /// The full command and arguments for the server to execute\n   pub command: Vec&lt;String&gt;,\n}\n\nOur run subcommand has 2 possible arguments.\n\nThe first, server_addr is an optional structopt(long) argument with a default value that aligns with the server default.\nThe second command is a required positional argument. Notice how there is no structopt attribute. The resulting vector from the variable-length argument. The parser splits up spaces per word, and provides them in order within the Vec&lt;String&gt;. (Matched quotes are interpreted as a single word in our situation). \n\nmain()🔗\nfn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {\n   let args = ApplicationArguments::from_args();\n\n   match args.subcommand {\n       SubCommand::StartServer(opts) =&gt; {\n           println!(\"Start the server on: {:?}\", opts.server_listen_addr);\n       }\n       SubCommand::Run(rc_opts) =&gt; {\n           println!(\"Run command: '{:?}'\", rc_opts.command);\n       }\n   }\n\n   Ok(())\n}\n\nOur main() is short and focused.\n\n\nOur return type is a Result. We return () when things are good, and returns a boxed trait object that implements the std::error::Error trait as our error (the return trait object is boxed, because Rust doesn’t know how much space to allocate).\n\n\nWe parse the user input using our StructOpt customized ApplicationArguments struct with from_args(). What’s great is invalid inputs are handled, and so we don’t need to spend any time straying from the happy path.\n\n\nAfter the parsing, we need to know what action to take next. We’ll either take a server action, or take a client action.\n\n\nWe pattern match on our SubCommand struct, and destructure the enum’s internal structs for the additional arguments.\n\n\nWe eventually will call out to the respective server or client to pass along the args. However for now we call println!() to display the values.\n\n\nAll together🔗\nmain.rs\nuse structopt::StructOpt;\n\n// These are the options used by the `server` subcommand\n#[derive(Debug, StructOpt)]\npub struct ServerOptions {\n   /// The address of the server that will run commands.\n   #[structopt(long, default_value = \"127.0.0.1:50051\")]\n   pub server_listen_addr: String,\n}\n\n// These are the options used by the `run` subcommand\n#[derive(Debug, StructOpt)]\npub struct RemoteCommandOptions {\n   /// The address of the server that will run commands.\n   #[structopt(long = \"server\", default_value = \"http://127.0.0.1:50051\")]\n   pub server_addr: String,\n   /// The full command and arguments for the server to execute\n   pub command: Vec&lt;String&gt;,\n}\n\n// These are the only valid values for our subcommands\n#[derive(Debug, StructOpt)]\npub enum SubCommand {\n   /// Start the remote command gRPC server\n   #[structopt(name = \"server\")]\n   StartServer(ServerOptions),\n   /// Send a remote command to the gRPC server\n   #[structopt(setting = structopt::clap::AppSettings::TrailingVarArg)]\n   Run(RemoteCommandOptions),\n}\n\n// This is the main arguments structure that we'll parse from\n#[derive(StructOpt, Debug)]\n#[structopt(name = \"remotecli\")]\nstruct ApplicationArguments {\n   #[structopt(flatten)]\n   pub subcommand: SubCommand,\n}\n\nfn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {\n   let args = ApplicationArguments::from_args();\n\n   match args.subcommand {\n       SubCommand::StartServer(opts) =&gt; {\n           println!(\"Start the server on: {:?}\", opts.server_listen_addr);\n       }\n       SubCommand::Run(rc_opts) =&gt; {\n           println!(\"Run command: '{:?}'\", rc_opts.command);\n       }\n   }\n\n   Ok(())\n}\n\nAnd that’s what we’ve done so far. This will be the full extent of the command line parsing functionality for this example, but we’ll revisit the main() function later.\nIf you’re following along, this code works with the cargo.toml provided at the top of this section. Play around using cargo.\nFor example try the following commands:\n\ncargo run --\ncargo run -- server\ncargo run -- server -h\ncargo run -- run\ncargo run -- run ls -al\ncargo run -- run -h\ncargo run -- blahblahblah\n\nProtocol Buffers🔗\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        \n\nWhat are Protocol Buffers?🔗\nProtocol Buffers (protobufs) are a way to define a data schema for how your data is structured as well as how to define how programs interface with each other w/ respect to your data in a language-independent manner.\nThis is achieved by writing your data in the protobuf format and compiling it into a supported language of your choice as implemented as gRPC.\nThe result of the compilation generates a lot of boilerplate code.\nNot just data structures with the same shape and naming conventions for your language’s native data types. But also generates the gRPC network code for the client that sends or the server that receives these generated data structures.\n\nFor what it’s worth, an added bonus are servers and clients having the possibility to be  implemented in different languages and inter-operate without issue due to. But we’re going to continue to work entirely in Rust for this example\nWhere should protobuf live in the codebase?🔗\nBefore jumping into the protobuf, I wanted to mention my practice for where to keep the file itself.\n$ tree\n.\n├── Cargo.lock\n├── Cargo.toml\n├── proto\n│   └── cli.proto\n└── src\n    └── main.rs\n\nI like to keep the protobuf in a directory named proto typically at the same level as the Cargo.toml because as we’ll see soon, the build script will need to reference a path to the protobuf for compilation. The file name itself is arbitrary and naming things is hard so do your best to support your future self with meaningful names.\nThe example protobuf🔗\ncli.proto🔗\nsyntax = \"proto3\";\n\npackage remotecli;\n\n// Command input\nmessage CommandInput {\n string command = 1;\n repeated string args = 2;\n}\n\n// Command output\nmessage CommandOutput {\n string output = 1;\n}\n\n// Service definition\nservice RemoteCLI {\n rpc Shell(CommandInput) returns (CommandOutput);\n}\n\nWe start the file off by declaring the particular version of syntax we’re using. proto3.\n\n\n\nWe need to provide a package name.\n\n\nThe proto3 docs say this is optional, but our protobuf Rust code generator Prost requires it to be defined for module namespacing and naming the resulting file.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefined are 2 data structures, called messages.\n\n\nThe order of the fields are numbered and are important for identifying fields in the wire protocol when they are serialized/deserialized for gRPC communication.\n\n\nThe numbers in the message must be unique and the best practice is to not change the numbers once in use. \n\n\n(For more details, read more about Field numbers in the docs.)\n\n\n\nThe CommandInput message has 2 string fields - one singular and the other repeated. \n\n\nThe main executable, which we refer to as command the first word of the user input.\n\n\nThe rest of the user input is reserved for args.\n\n\nThe separation is meant to provide structure for the way a command interpreter like Bash defines commands.\n\n\n\n\nThe CommandOutput message doesn’t need quite as much structure. After a command is run, the Standard Output will be returned as a single block of text.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we define a service RemoteCLI with a single endpoint Shell.\n\n\nShell takes a CommandInput and returns a CommandOutput.\n\n\nCompile the protobuf into Rust code with Tonic🔗\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        \n\nNow that we have a protobuf, how do we use it in our Rust program when we need to use the generated code?\nWell, we need to configure the build to compile the protobuf into Rust first.\nThe way we accomplish that is by using a build script (Surprise! Written in Rust) but is compiled and executed before the rest of the compilation occurs.\nCargo will run your build script if you have a file named build.rs in your project root.\n$ tree\n.\n├── build.rs\n├── Cargo.toml\n├── proto\n│   └── cli.proto\n└── src\n    └── main.rs\n\nbuild.rs🔗\nfn main() {\n   tonic_build::compile_protos(\"proto/cli.proto\").unwrap();\n}\n\nThe build script is just a small Rust program with a main() function.\nWe’re using tonic_build to compile our proto into Rust. We’ll see more tonic soon for the rest of our gRPC journey.\nBut for now we only need to add this crate into our Cargo.toml as a build dependency.\nCargo.toml\n[package]\nname = \"cli-grpc-tonic-blocking\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nauthors = [\"T.J.

If you didn’t know, your build scripts can only use crates listed in this section, and vice versa with the main package.\nYou can look at the resulting Rust code in your target directory when you cargo build.\nYou’ll have more than one directory with your package name plus extra generated characters due to build script output. So you may need to look through multiple directories.\n$ tree target/debug/build/cli-grpc-tonic-blocking-aa0556a3d0cd89ff/\ntarget/debug/build/cli-grpc-tonic-blocking-aa0556a3d0cd89ff/\n├── invoked.timestamp\n├── out\n│   └── remotecli.rs\n├── output\n├── root-output\n└── stderr\n\nI’ll leave the contents of the generated code to those following along, since there’s a lot of it and the relevant info is either from the proto or will be covered in the server and client implementation.\nThis code will only generate once. Or unless you make changes to build.rs. So if you make changes to your proto and you want to regenerate code, you can force a code regen by using touch.\n$ touch build.rs\n$ cargo build\n\nServer🔗\nMoving onto writing our server now that we can use the protobuf generated code. We’re going to write the server (and client) in a new module.\n$ tree\n.\n├── build.rs\n├── Cargo.toml\n├── proto\n│   └── cli.proto\n└── src\n    ├── main.rs\n    └── remotecli\n        ├── mod.rs\n        └── server.rs\n\nCargo.toml🔗\n[package]\nname = \"cli-grpc-tonic-blocking\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nauthors = [\"T.J.

Prost is the implementation of protocol buffers in Rust, and is needed to compile the generated code when we include it into the rest of the package.\nTokio is the async runtime we’re using. The gRPC server/client are async and we will need to adjust our main() to communicate more in the code that we’re now calling async functions..\nremotecli/mod.rs🔗\npub mod server;\n\nTo keep the implementations organized, we’ll separate the server and client code further into their own modules. Starting with the server.\nremotecli/server.rs🔗\nSimilar to the frontend CLI walkthrough, I’ll break this file up into pieces and review them.\nAt the bottom of this file’s section I’ll have the complete file there for copy/paste purposes.\nImports🔗\nuse tonic::{transport::Server, Request, Response, Status};\n\n// Import the generated rust code into module\npub mod remotecli_proto {\n   tonic::include_proto!(\"remotecli\");\n}\n\n// Proto generated server traits\nuse remotecli_proto::remote_cli_server::{RemoteCli, RemoteCliServer};\n\n// Proto message structs\nuse remotecli_proto::{CommandInput, CommandOutput};\n\n// For the server listening address\nuse crate::ServerOptions;\n\n// For executing commands\nuse std::process::{Command, Stdio};\n\n\n\nAt the top of the file, we declare a module remotecli_proto that is intended to be scoped only in this file. The name remotecli_proto is arbitrary and for clarity purposes. \n\n\nThe tonic::include_proto!() macro effectively copy/pastes our protobuf translated Rust code (as per protobuf package name)  into the module.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe naming conventions of the protobuf translation can be a little confusing at first, but it is all consistent.\n\n\nOur protobuf’s RemoteCLI service generates separate client and server modules using snake case + _server or _client. While generated trait definitions use Pascal case (a specific form of camel case with initial letter capitalized).\n\n\nFrom the server specific generated code, we are importing a trait RemoteCli which requires that we implement our gRPC endpoint Shell with the same function signature.\n\n\nAdditionally we import RemoteCliServer, a generated server implementation that handles all the gRPC networking semantics but requires that we instantiate with a struct that implements the RemoteCli trait.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last import from the gRPC code are our protobuf messages CommandInput and CommandOutput\n\n\nFrom our frontend, we are importing the ServerOptions struct, since we are going to pass the user input in for the server listening address.\n\n\n\nAt last, we import from std::process. Command and Stdio - for executing commands and capturing output.\nRemoteCli Trait implementation🔗\n#[derive(Default)]\npub struct Cli {}\n\n#[tonic::async_trait]\nimpl RemoteCli for Cli {\n   async fn shell(\n       &amp;self,\n       request: Request&lt;CommandInput&gt;,\n   ) -&gt; Result&lt;Response&lt;CommandOutput&gt;, Status&gt; {\n       let req_command = request.into_inner();\n       let command = req_command.command;\n       let args = req_command.args;\n\n       println!(\"Running command: {:?} - args: {:?}\", &amp;command, &amp;args);\n\n       let process = Command::new(command)\n           .args(args)\n           .stdout(Stdio::piped())\n           .spawn()\n           .expect(\"failed to execute child process\");\n\n       let output = process\n           .wait_with_output()\n           .expect(\"failed to wait on child process\");\n       let output = output.stdout;\n\n       Ok(Response::new(CommandOutput {\n           output: String::from_utf8(output).unwrap(),\n       }))\n   }\n}\n\n\n\nWe declare our own struct Cli because we need to impl RemoteCli.\n\n\nOur generated code uses an async method. We add #[tonic::async_trait] to our trait impl so the server can use async fn on our method. We just have one method to define, async fn shell().\n\n\n\n\nI’m 👋waving my hands👋 here for the function signature, but the way I initially learned how to write them was to go into the generated code, skimmed the code within the remote_cli_server module and modified the crate paths.\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing we do when we enter shell is peel off the tonic wrapping from request with .into_inner(). We further separate the ownership of data into command and args vars.\n\n\nWe build out process as the std::process::Command struct so we can spawn the user’s process and capture stdout.\n\n\nThen we wait for process to exit and collect the output with .wait_with_output(). We just want stdout so we further take ownership of just that handle.\n\n\n\n\nLast, we build a tonic::Response, converting the process stdout into a String while we instantiate our CommandOutput. Finally wrapping the Response in a Result and returning it to the client.\n\nstart_server🔗\npub async fn start_server(opts: ServerOptions) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {\n   let addr = opts.server_listen_addr.parse().unwrap();\n   let cli_server = Cli::default();\n\n   println!(\"RemoteCliServer listening on {}\", addr);\n\n   Server::builder()\n       .add_service(RemoteCliServer::new(cli_server))\n       .serve(addr)\n       .await?;\n\n   Ok(())\n}\n\n\nThis function will be used by the frontend for the purpose of starting the server.\n\n\n\nThe listening address is passed in through opts. It’s passed in as a String, but the compiler figures out what type we mean when we call .parse() due to how we use it later.\n\n\n\nWe instantiate cli_server with the Cli struct which we implemented as the protobuf trait RemoteCli. \n\n\n\n\ntonic::Server::builder() creates our gRPC server instance.\n\n\nThe .add_service() method takes RemoteCliServer::new(cli_server) to create a gRPC server with our generated endpoints via RemoteCliServer and our trait impl via cli_server.\n\n\nThe serve() method takes in our parsed listening address, providing the hint the compiler needed to infer the required type and returns an async Result&lt;T&gt;  for us to .await on.\n\n\nmain.rs - so far🔗\nWe are making small changes to main.rs to plug in the server module. \npub mod remotecli;\n\nuse structopt::StructOpt;\n\n// These are the options used by the `server` subcommand\n#[derive(Debug, StructOpt)]\npub struct ServerOptions {\n   /// The address of the server that will run commands.\n   #[structopt(long, default_value = \"127.0.0.1:50051\")]\n   pub server_listen_addr: String,\n}\n\n// These are the options used by the `run` subcommand\n#[derive(Debug, StructOpt)]\npub struct RemoteCommandOptions {\n   /// The address of the server that will run commands.\n   #[structopt(long = \"server\", default_value = \"http://127.0.0.1:50051\")]\n   pub server_addr: String,\n   /// The full command and arguments for the server to execute\n   pub command: Vec&lt;String&gt;,\n}\n\n// These are the only valid values for our subcommands\n#[derive(Debug, StructOpt)]\npub enum SubCommand {\n   /// Start the remote command gRPC server\n   #[structopt(name = \"server\")]\n   StartServer(ServerOptions),\n   /// Send a remote command to the gRPC server\n   #[structopt(setting = structopt::clap::AppSettings::TrailingVarArg)]\n   Run(RemoteCommandOptions),\n}\n\n// This is the main arguments structure that we'll parse from\n#[derive(StructOpt, Debug)]\n#[structopt(name = \"remotecli\")]\nstruct ApplicationArguments {\n   #[structopt(flatten)]\n   pub subcommand: SubCommand,\n}\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {\n   let args = ApplicationArguments::from_args();\n\n   match args.subcommand {\n       SubCommand::StartServer(opts) =&gt; {\n           println!(\"Start the server on: {:?}\", opts.server_listen_addr);\n           remotecli::server::start_server(opts).await?;\n       }\n       SubCommand::Run(rc_opts) =&gt; {\n           println!(\"Run command: '{:?}'\", rc_opts.command);\n\n\n       }\n   }\n\n   Ok(())\n}\n\n\n\nWe now import our remotecli module.\n\n\nThe main() function changes slightly as well. First, we change the function to be async.\n\n\nWe add the #[tokio::main] attribute to mark the async function for execution.\n\n\nAnd we call our new start_server() to actually start a server when the user runs the server subcommand.\n\n\nremotecli/server.rs all together🔗\nHere’s the final form of the server module.\nuse tonic::{transport::Server, Request, Response, Status};\n\n// Import the generated rust code into module\npub mod remotecli_proto {\n   tonic::include_proto!(\"remotecli\");\n}\n\n// Proto generated server traits\nuse remotecli_proto::remote_cli_server::{RemoteCli, RemoteCliServer};\n\n// Proto message structs\nuse remotecli_proto::{CommandInput, CommandOutput};\n\n// For the server listening address\nuse crate::ServerOptions;\n\n// For executing commands\nuse std::process::{Command, Stdio};\n\n#[derive(Default)]\npub struct Cli {}\n\n#[tonic::async_trait]\nimpl RemoteCli for Cli {\n   async fn shell(\n       &amp;self,\n       request: Request&lt;CommandInput&gt;,\n   ) -&gt; Result&lt;Response&lt;CommandOutput&gt;, Status&gt; {\n       let req_command = request.into_inner();\n       let command = req_command.command;\n       let args = req_command.args;\n\n       println!(\"Running command: {:?} - args: {:?}\", &amp;command, &amp;args);\n\n       let process = Command::new(command)\n           .args(args)\n           .stdout(Stdio::piped())\n           .spawn()\n           .expect(\"failed to execute child process\");\n\n       let output = process\n           .wait_with_output()\n           .expect(\"failed to wait on child process\");\n       let output = output.stdout;\n\n       Ok(Response::new(CommandOutput {\n           output: String::from_utf8(output).unwrap(),\n       }))\n   }\n}\n\npub async fn start_server(opts: ServerOptions) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {\n   let addr = opts.server_listen_addr.parse().unwrap();\n   let cli_server = Cli::default();\n\n   println!(\"RemoteCliServer listening on {}\", addr);\n\n   Server::builder()\n       .add_service(RemoteCliServer::new(cli_server))\n       .serve(addr)\n       .await?;\n\n   Ok(())\n}\n\nAnd that’s the server implementation and the frontend code for starting the server.

We’re going to create a new module within remotecli called client.rs that will follow the same patterns as we established for the server.\n$ tree\n.\n├── build.rs\n├── Cargo.toml\n├── proto\n│   └── cli.proto\n└── src\n    ├── main.rs\n    └── remotecli\n      \t├── client.rs\n        ├── mod.rs\n        └── server.rs\n\nremotecli/mod.rs🔗\npub mod client;\npub mod server;\n\nWe’re declaring the client module within mod.rs \nremotecli/client.rs🔗\nOur client is a lot more straightforward. But splitting the module up into pieces for description purposes. \nAgain, full file is at the end of the section\nImports🔗\npub mod remotecli_proto {\n   tonic::include_proto!(\"remotecli\");\n}\n\n// Proto generated client\nuse remotecli_proto::remote_cli_client::RemoteCliClient;\n\n// Proto message structs\nuse remotecli_proto::CommandInput;\n\nuse crate::RemoteCommandOptions;\n\n\n\nJust like in our server, we create a module remotecli_proto and we use the tonic::include_proto!() macro to copy/paste our generated code into this module.\n\n\nWe then include the generated RemoteCliClient to connect, and the CommandInput struct since that is what we send over to the server.\n\n\nLast include is the RemoteCommandOptions struct from the frontend so we can pass in the server address we want to connect to.\n\n\nclient_run🔗\npub async fn client_run(rc_opts: RemoteCommandOptions) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {\n   // Connect to server\n   // Use server addr if given, otherwise use default\n   let mut client = RemoteCliClient::connect(rc_opts.server_addr).await?;\n\n   let request = tonic::Request::new(CommandInput {\n       command: rc_opts.command[0].clone().into(),\n       args: rc_opts.command[1..].to_vec(),\n   });\n\n   let response = client.shell(request).await?;\n\n   println!(\"RESPONSE={:?}\", response);\n\n   Ok(())\n}\n\n\nThe helper function client_run() is an async function like our server. The frontend passes in a RemoteCommandOptions struct for the server address info as well as our raw user command.\n\n\n\nFirst thing we do is create client and connect to the server with RemoteCliClient::connect and do an .await.\n\n\n\n\nThen we build our request by creating a tonic::Request struct with our CommandInput.\n\n\nThe user command is raw and needs to be sliced up to fit the shape of what the server expects. The first word of the user command is the shell command, and the rest are the arguments.\n\n\n\n\nLastly we use client and call our endpoint with our request and .await for the execution to complete.\n\nmain.rs🔗\nThis is the final form of main.rs. The last thing we do to main.rs is plug in our client_run() function.\npub mod remotecli;\n\nuse structopt::StructOpt;\n\n// These are the options used by the `server` subcommand\n#[derive(Debug, StructOpt)]\npub struct ServerOptions {\n   /// The address of the server that will run commands.\n   #[structopt(long, default_value = \"127.0.0.1:50051\")]\n   pub server_listen_addr: String,\n}\n\n// These are the options used by the `run` subcommand\n#[derive(Debug, StructOpt)]\npub struct RemoteCommandOptions {\n   /// The address of the server that will run commands.\n   #[structopt(long = \"server\", default_value = \"http://127.0.0.1:50051\")]\n   pub server_addr: String,\n   /// The full command and arguments for the server to execute\n   pub command: Vec&lt;String&gt;,\n}\n\n// These are the only valid values for our subcommands\n#[derive(Debug, StructOpt)]\npub enum SubCommand {\n   /// Start the remote command gRPC server\n   #[structopt(name = \"server\")]\n   StartServer(ServerOptions),\n   /// Send a remote command to the gRPC server\n   #[structopt(setting = structopt::clap::AppSettings::TrailingVarArg)]\n   Run(RemoteCommandOptions),\n}\n\n// This is the main arguments structure that we'll parse from\n#[derive(StructOpt, Debug)]\n#[structopt(name = \"remotecli\")]\nstruct ApplicationArguments {\n   #[structopt(flatten)]\n   pub subcommand: SubCommand,\n}\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {\n   let args = ApplicationArguments::from_args();\n\n   match args.subcommand {\n       SubCommand::StartServer(opts) =&gt; {\n           println!(\"Start the server on: {:?}\", opts.server_listen_addr);\n           remotecli::server::start_server(opts).await?;\n       }\n       SubCommand::Run(rc_opts) =&gt; {\n           println!(\"Run command: '{:?}'\", rc_opts.command);\n           remotecli::client::client_run(rc_opts).await?;\n       }\n   }\n\n   Ok(())\n}\n\nremotecli/client.rs all together🔗\npub mod remotecli_proto {\n   tonic::include_proto!(\"remotecli\");\n}\n\n// Proto generated client\nuse remotecli_proto::remote_cli_client::RemoteCliClient;\n\n// Proto message structs\nuse remotecli_proto::CommandInput;\n\nuse crate::RemoteCommandOptions;\n\npub async fn client_run(rc_opts: RemoteCommandOptions) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn std::error::Error&gt;&gt; {\n   // Connect to server\n   // Use server addr if given, otherwise use default\n   let mut client = RemoteCliClient::connect(rc_opts.server_addr).await?;\n\n   let request = tonic::Request::new(CommandInput {\n       command: rc_opts.command[0].clone().into(),\n       args: rc_opts.command[1..].to_vec(),\n   });\n\n   let response = client.shell(request).await?;\n\n   println!(\"RESPONSE={:?}\", response);\n\n   Ok(())\n}\n\nFinal demonstration🔗\nTo see this server-client end-to-end, we'll need two terminal windows open. In one, run the server, and in the other we'll run a simple ls command.\nServer🔗\n$ cargo run -- server\n[...]\nStart the server on: \"127.0.0.1:50051\"\nRemoteCliServer listening on 127.0.0.1:50051\n\nClient🔗\n$ cargo run -- run ls\n\nOutput🔗\nRun command: '[\"ls\"]'\nRESPONSE=Response { metadata: MetadataMap { headers: {\"content-type\": \"application/grpc\", \"date\": \"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 00:00:25 GMT\", \"grpc-status\": \"0\"} }, message: CommandOutput { output: \"build.rs\\nCargo.toml\\nproto\\nsrc\\n\" } }\n\nAs we see, there is still work left to do in order to format the output in a more human readable way. But that is an exercise left to the reader.\nConclusion🔗\nWe just walked through building a CLI application that parses user input and uses gRPC to send a command from a gRPC client to the server for execution and return of command output.\nBased on how we structured the frontend CLI using StructOpt, we allowed both the client and server to compile into a single binary. \nProtocol buffers (or protobufs) were used to define the interfaces of the server and the data structures that were used. The Tonic and Prost crates and Cargo build scripts were used to compile the protobufs into native async Rust code.\nTokio was our async runtime. We experienced how little code was necessary to support async/await patterns.\nThanks for joining me as I stepped through the details. I hope that this walkthrough satisfies some curiosity about using gRPC for your backend code. As well as piqued your interest in writing some Rust code.\n","description":"A detailed quick-start example for experienced devs using gRPC with Rust","id":"https://tjtelan.com/blog/lets-build-a-single-binary-grpc-server-client-with-rust-in-2020/","path":"/blog/lets-build-a-single-binary-grpc-server-client-with-rust-in-2020/","title":"Let’s build a single binary gRPC server-client with Rust in 2020"},"https://tjtelan.com/blog/metawatch-has-arrived/":{"body":"I just got my digital MetaWatch this morning after 3 months of delays from TI.\nI'm still playing around with the watch.

But eventually the news of the changes rolled out in a much more official way! For what it’s worth, I approve.\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        Better late than never\n\nThe change to make eligible repos opt-in will hopefully provide less of an unexpected disruption to open source maintainers. I imagine the spike in activity will belong to repos who want the commits. Also I hope the intended effect will cut down on greedy devs gaming the rules with low quality contributions to get free stuff.\nThe extended review time was still 2 weeks, but a couple days later after my post, I got an email acknowledging my 4 PRs. I’ve just been waiting for the clock to run out this entire time.\nHowever, the time is here.

I took a simple approach.\nI crawled the Github search for Hacktoberfest labeled repos that were written in Rust because I was only interested in writing in that language.\nThere were quite a lot, so I picked a handful of the smallest Rust projects where the repo owner asked for some very specific contributions that were clear enough that it didn’t require me to ask questions before getting started. All things considered, it only took me a total of 2-3 hours to write code.\nI did a bit of overcommunication with the repo maintainer to be friendly, but also to give the impression that changes can still be made with their feedback. I wanted to offer an opportunity for them to give me feedback so they would be happy with what they would get merged in.\nIf you didn’t know, you can reference issues from your commit message, which I did. Additionally I linked the PR to the issue, and I left a message in the issue itself describing my thought process.  There were small changes requested by the maintainers, though every PR was eventually accepted and merged.\nThe Prize🔗\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        Am I a digital lorax? Because I wrote code for the trees\n\nSo I’ve decided to plant a tree instead of receiving a shirt. It was nice that there was an alternative.\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        There was only one color and one size. Fun!\n\nI don’t know what’s next. After completing the form I was told to await instructions from Digital Ocean for how to continue the process of planting the tree.\nEither way, this is the end of the line. Hacktoberfest 2020 is done for me. I feel happy to have made a positive impact.\nThanks to Digital Ocean, Intel, Dev.to and the Hacktoberfest team for making this year happen!\n\nIn the future I will likely crawl the Github search for small Rust projects to contribute to live on my Twitch stream. If that interests you, or if you’d like me to contribute to your repo, then I’d appreciate it if you’d give me a follow! \n","description":"I finished Hacktoberfest 2020. How did I do?

It even uses shell scripting terminology like pipelines, but is obscured with marketing and many seemingly complex and different methods of configuration.\nThe purpose of this post is to discuss Continuous Integration (CI) Systems at a high level if you are considering switching to a new service. I want to introduce you to a few talking points that aren't discussed enough in order to help you make a decision.\nWhat are the goals of Continuous Integration (CI)?🔗\nThe functions of continuous integration are very flexible and therefore, and the goals are super simple. Automatically run scripts upon the occurrence of an event.\nCommon events can be a git commit or a timer event set to run every 5 minutes.\nHow does CI differ from shell scripting?🔗\nContinuous integration has a narrow context in which it is intended to run. It has extra structure in order to tell a tighter story. (The CI story leads into another story called Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD), but we will only be focusing on CI)\nA best practice of CI is to automatically build and/or run tests on every commit in order to validate whether the codebase builds/tests are complete without errors.\nBasic structure defines conditions as well as commands or actions that should be executed when an event occurs. Conditions such as a new commit in a specific branch, or file paths. Or keywords in commit messages.\nOn the more advanced side, platform specific features like plugins may be introduced for sending or receiving events from other systems, initiating external triggers based on other pipelines, caching, cleaning up and notifications.\nWhat type of CI systems that exist today?🔗\nThere is no shortage of software that is designed for Continuous Integration. What I believe sets these platforms apart from each other is:\n\nThe experience and effort involved with setting up a new environment for your organization\nPath to configuring new pipelines, and maintaining them over time.\n\nIf your organization regularly exercises the creation of new environments, like in consulting orgs, it is reasonable to gain the experience with an open source tool that won’t cost you any money with licensing.\nOtherwise, I might suggest picking a system the reduces the friction for pipeline creation and maintenance.\n\nStyles of setting up new pipelines falls into two categories.\nStateful (WebUI) pipeline config🔗\nJenkins is the primary example of configuration via WebUI, as it is the functionality out of the box. Adding pipelines in this system requires a user to log into the WebUI, configure connections to builder systems and methodically define pipelines.\nPros🔗\n\nThe biggest player in this space, Jenkins, is free to install with flexible system requirements.\nRelatively low skill required to get started. Setup of pipelines and any subsequent edits are performed through the browser with a few clicks.\nMany plugins exist, which probably suit the needs of your org.\nMost of the CI in this category are older and mature. Very search engine friendly solutions.\n\nCons🔗\n\nAdministration is more difficult and time consuming to perform as footprint increases. Over time the details of the pipeline configuration may drift and be difficult to reproduce for the purposes of documentation or migration.\nIt is easy to neglect this kind of CI installation. Both a testament to stability, and a detriment to your org when unexpected outages occur. Rebuilding can be tedious and error prone.\nTakes a lot of effort to secure natively in a cloud-based future. Typically these CI systems inconveniently end up hiding behind a VPN.\n\nStateless (File-based) pipeline config🔗\nThis is the modern style of CI system. Your TravisCI, Github Action, Azure DevOps\nTypically we find this system is hosted through your git provider, or as a separate hosted service that we allow access to the repos. YAML is the most popular config format. \nPros🔗\n\nConfiguration of pipelines stay versioned alongside the codebases that use them.\n\nCons🔗\n\nNo config schema standards, though. most use a yaml format.\nComplexity becomes harder to manage, and requires a commit and push to repos in order to test. Testing contributes clutter in git logs, and uses up build minutes, which is the cost unit that many hosted services bill on.\nLimited self-hosted options that are free.\nLimited self-hosted options that have small system requirements\n\nMy opinion🔗\nI strongly prefer the stateless type of configuration because it provides a more code-like arena where documentation can be provided.\nMixing the workflow of CI pipeline configuration with your organization’s version control practices can be disruptive if you need to push code in order to see the results of changes to your pipeline. It is a price to pay for the ability to easily correlate changes in codebase with changes in pipeline.\nThe balance to strike rests on your code hosting provider needs (i.e. costs per user) and the types of technologies and platforms you need to support for building (web, native, mobile, embedded, etc). This flexibility mostly skews support towards building for web-based technologies.\nAlso, Jenkins technically has file-based pipeline support via Jenkinsfile, but unless my org was already deeply invested in staying with Jenkins, I would steer clear. It is not the future. It is harder than necessary to use.\nWhat are the CI Hosting Options?🔗\nSelf-hosting🔗\nSelf-hosting means running and maintaining a process on a physical or virtual machine that you have access to.\nPros🔗\n\nSomewhat more private for less effort if hosting in a private location.\nEffective use of data center computers. Initial costs may be higher, but maintenance costs are typically lower.\n\nCons🔗\n\nBeing responsible for maintenance\nLimited to the platforms that you have available.\n\nSystem as a Service (Hosted)🔗\nExternal systems as a service (Hosted services) allow users to just log in and connect their version control.\nPros🔗\n\nNot responsible for performing maintenance.\nTypically authentication is provided, with options to support your org’s auth provider\n\nCons🔗\n\nCan be expensive if you require a lot of build time or resources\nShrinking caps on “free” resources for open source projects\n\nIssues to Consider when Switching between CI platforms🔗\nThese are some categorized rhetorical questions that you or your organization should ask if you are migrating CI platforms\nThreat model🔗\n\nDo you need to be deployed on-site?\nWhat are the upfront and ongoing costs associated?\nDo you have secrets (like private keys, API tokens) that are needed at build time?\n\nContributor model🔗\n\nHow are contributors logging in?\nWhat are the costs associated per seat?\n\nMaintenance🔗\n\nWho is responsible for the health of the pipeline?\nHow much time/money are you budgeting to spend on maintenance and improvements?\n\nCost of Build minutes🔗\n\nFor open source projects, how many build minutes are being used?\n\nResponsiveness needs🔗\n\nHow many concurrent builds does your org require?\n\nTechnologies used🔗\n\nContainerizing builds is popular for isolation. But not all projects can build within a container.\nApple, Microsoft and embedded projects are not nearly as flexible and may require special considerations or resources.\n\nDelivery/Deployment model🔗\n\nWhat do you need to happen after a build passes?\nAre you creating a build artifact that needs to be stored somewhere?\nWhat is the desired frequency between build vs delivery/deploy?\n\nConclusion🔗\nNot all continuous integration is considered equal. But they all provide basically the same functions. In most cases, it is possible to self-host and do everything yourself. But sometimes it is worth paying money to a product / service that takes care of your needs. It is really all about making sure you know what the trade-offs are for your specific case.\n","description":"Questions to ask if you're considering switching CI systems","id":"https://tjtelan.com/blog/questions-to-find-the-right-continuous-integration-system-for-you/","path":"/blog/questions-to-find-the-right-continuous-integration-system-for-you/","title":"Questions to Find the Right Continuous Integration System for You"},"https://tjtelan.com/blog/quick-primer-reference-environments/":{"body":"Overview🔗\nThis post is inspired by a larger Twitter thread by James Munns about industry practices to follow for embedded systems projects that are not covered in school. Particularly the concept of a reference environment. However this idea is important across all platforms of software development. \nOur aim is to be pragmatic to a wide audience of “Developers” and not to be confused with the goals of the reproducible builds project. (I’m not worrying about achieving complete build environment determinism. There is a lot more involved that is out of scope for this discussion, but I encourage others to check it out.)\nWhat’s the benefit?🔗\nThe benefit of a reference environment is to allow a practical step-by-step plan for individuals to reproduce a suitable environment in order to build from a codebase, produce artifacts and interface with any external hardware.\nI want to help you form a maintainable process of documenting what is needed to build your code, and create artifacts for release.\nThe expected outcome is to create a reference environment for build and release purposes.\nAn additional side-effect of this effort is a shortening of the effort to onboard new devs and testers into new projects or codebases. Additionally version control of this process will reduce your organization’s institutional knowledge.\nYour reference environment can be used for:🔗\n\nCI environments\nOnboarding new developers\nProjects that don’t get modified very often\nEmbedded projects\nMobile projects\nProjects with private code\nProjects with vendored / version pinned code\nLegacy code\n\nStart your reference environment in steps🔗\nFirst level: Automate what is easy and Document what is hard🔗\nYou need to have a step-by-step set of commands to run that walk you through downloading and installing your tools in order to enable others to build their own reference environment. Tools and libraries installed through a package manager, and anything manually installed off a website.\nThe goal of documenting the setup of your local environment can then be further streamlined the more you automate the step-by-step into scripts that you can provide.\nThe experience you want to cultivate is a relatively short step from a fresh clone, to building and modifying code.\nIf you use a language that has its own package manager used to compile, such as Javascript’s NPM, Java’s Maven or Rust’s Cargo, then you are able to keep track of the names and version numbers of the libraries you use.\nI recommend that you learn how to use these tools to also remove files created during build. Cached files from previous builds are classic causes of “works on my machine” and may hide otherwise obvious issues. Make a habit of trying to reproduce issues starting from a cache-free build by using the same tools for build to also remove the files and directories it creates.\nNot all language package managers come with cleanup functionality, so you may need to install  plugins. Otherwise you should use a tool like make, and create separate make build and make clean targets.\nSecond level: Shell scripts🔗\nAutomation should be driven by makefiles or plain shell scripts like bash/zsh/fish/sh or in windows batch or powershell. The rationale is that these are plain commands that you can copy/paste from your terminal, and into the script. You can always call out to another language like python/ruby/perl or other tools.\nBut the initial point of functionality should be plain shell scripting through an executable shell script or a Makefile.\nIf you are working from an existing step-by-step document, then you should have a sequence of commands that you can transfer straight into your script. This is a lot fewer commands for your future users (and future you) to deal with.\nThird level: Configuration management🔗\nThere are tools that specifically deal with configuration management of your operating system / development environment. One of their main selling points is declaring the desired state through config files instead of scripting everything step-by-step. The tools read the config files and check the system for differences. If differences are found, then these tools take specific actions in order to attempt to bring the reality of the system state to be the same as the config.\nThe config files lend themselves into achieving automation that is “idempotent”. A simple explanation of idempotency with respect to configuration automation is experienced when running the automation twice in succession. The first time, an automation tool takes a moment to execute because work is being performed. The second time, the tool discovers that there is no work to be done so the execution time is significantly reduced.\nExamples:\n\nAnsible\nSaltstack\nPuppet\nChef\n\nIn your shell scripts, you need to install these config management tools first. But then the tools can replace significant volumes of shell scripts in many cases because their idempotent properties lead to more efficient execution. The more popular tools have an added benefit of wide support of different OSes, allowing your configs to also widely support different OSes.\nNext level: Portable Reference Environments via Virtual Machines &amp; Containers🔗\nBuilding your reference environment within a virtual machine may enable you to be a little less strict about documenting and automating your setup. After you build the environment, you can save a snapshot, back it up or even distribute it to others. This can be convenient and portable in most cases.\nYou can also use your scripts or config management to configure virtual machines, or containers. Using tools like Vagrant or Docker allow you to store the instructions for building virtual machines (via Vagrantfile) or containers (via Dockerfile) alongside your code. This enables potential contribution without the need of installing tools locally because the codebase includes a portable development environment.\nPlatform specific caveats🔗\nVirtualization or containerization is not an available option for every platform. In these cases, you may be limited to config management or documentation for your reference environments.\nIf your project has the following, you may have limited support for a portable reference environment. \n\nApple products\nPlatform-specific tools like IDEs and/or compilers\nHardware requirements such as GPU\nVery old “Legacy” OSes\n\nConclusion🔗\nThe specific tools, and libraries you use in development may seem obvious to you. But as a courtesy to an outsider, or even to yourself in the future, you need to provide requirements needed to build your code.\nDocumentation requires discipline to keep up-to-date. Scripts, config management or even a portable environment such as a virtual machine or a container are even better because they are easier to verify for correctness.\nThe less critically someone needs to think in order to get started, the easier it will be to focus on what matters. Reference environments are not one-size-fits all. They may be unique per project, or organization. Do future you or future team members a favor and write these details down. It can save a lot of time and avoid works-on-my-machine.\n","description":"Make contributing easy.

I thought it would be a good idea to answer these questions so that I can share my opinions around how I read through technical content.\nWhy do I like a piece of technical content?🔗\nI can answer this in different ways depending on the context that leads me to find technical content. The main two contexts being discovered through social media, or via a search engine.\nThrough social media🔗\nI spend a lot of time on technical social media, like Reddit, Hacker News, Dev.to, and Twitter and I mostly only read the trending posts. So in these cases, an individual’s or company’s personality drives my interest over the actual content.\nA lot of the time this leads to some cult of personality for popular posts in the comment section. This can’t be helped. However, this kind of engagement occasionally leads to interesting and tangential discussion. I like when the author can participate in the discussion as well, but this is a rare occurrence.\nI prefer concepts over code in the case of social media discovery. Emphasis when I’m reading through something that is about an ecosystem I don’t have experience using. I like having my hand held lightly, and guided through the examples with metaphor or images.\nBonus points if you both provide links for more context, as well as provide a simplified summary. Help frame how I should think, and even give negative examples for how I should not think if it helps.\nThese posts are primarily to entertain me, and then to inform me. I want the attention to readability with layout and markup to be more considered. If there are images to help set tone, I’d rather they be well used memes, or diagrams.\nThrough search🔗\nIf I’m searching for something technical, it’s more likely that I’m doing research, design or implementation. So personality may continue to play a role in my likelihood to revisit an article, but the code snippets and coherence of an explanation is more important.\nBonus points if consideration was made for keyword searching or organized textbook-like. I don’t need my hand held as much in his case. Just point me in a direction. I don’t want the entire post to be read through carefully unless the post is about low-level detail.\nI’ll be grumpy, but I will endure a post that is harder to skim if the content is promising enough.\nWho is their intended audience?🔗\nPart of reading a lot of technical content means reading things that are not specifically targeted at myself.\nWhen the content involves discussion of code, I really prefer a lot of gentle, but explicit nudging around the skill level required to make sense of what is in the post.\nWide audience is generally my least favorite because content has to be high-level enough to not lose anyone. If you’re aiming wide, then say so or be very obvious. \nTextbook-style is good enough for me. Build up concepts in a reasonable sequence. Or link to posts or definitions that talk about foundational concepts that you’re introducing. Unless you’ve already stated an expected skill level, I will feel like you don’t know the audience you’re writing to.\nWhat does this (company/individual) do really well?🔗\nThis kind of question is mostly for judging a collection of posts. Any single post may have left positive impressions on me of being informative, concise, funny, easy to read. But I don’t feel like I can judge what the competencies or patterns of a company or individual is until I see other work.\nI look for consistency in voice. Are we having a conversation. Am I reading a monologue? Do you know where your content beats and break things up with whitespace or images? Are you flexible enough with how you present ideas so that I understand you or know what homework I have in order to understand? Visual branding also comes into mind when discussing consistency. \nWhat does this content help me do?🔗\nMy expectations of what the content offers me is again, dependent on the context in which I was introduced.\nIn general, if it is through social media, I’m looking first to have some kind of entertainment aspect. I’m looking for a breadth of information that allows me to insert my own ideas. I know that content creators aren’t always in control of where and when their content is posted, so this isn’t always going to be fair to judge entertainment value when the content is informational. But it is a plus if the author can be engaging and educational because it takes effort to do well.\nConversely, if it is through organic search, I’m looking for some kind of informational value. Help me solve a problem, or understand a model of thinking better.\nHow would doing (or implementing) “X” improve my content?🔗\nThis is a great question. Often when I ask myself this question, I’m considering the visual branding of an individual. But lately I’ve also been thinking about how my favorite creators structure and pace the flow of information in their posts while balancing their voice. This is why it is a good idea to follow content creators that resonate with you, because everyone learns to strike this balance differently. And typically the more someone writes technical content, the more natural and easier to read they get.\nWhat can they improve upon to make this content even more effective?🔗\nAt least for me, it is easier to edit someone else’s work. Naturally, I’m constantly thinking about how little bits of friction can be smoothed out and so that I could understand it better. This could mean mixing the styles of creators together, and I try to identify creators who are particularly good (or sometimes bad) at one thing so I can pay attention to how their style evolves.\nConclusion🔗\nI don’t know if this post will be useful to others, but it was a good exercise for me. If you’re a content creator, I encourage you to read through Stephanie’s original post. Ask yourself these questions and try to give concrete answers. \n","description":"Answering the questions asked in Stephanie Morillo's post about how to improve your content creation skills","id":"https://tjtelan.com/blog/re-reading-more-technical-content-can-help-you-improve-your-content-creation-skills/","path":"/blog/re-reading-more-technical-content-can-help-you-improve-your-content-creation-skills/","title":"Re: Reading More Technical Content Can Help You Improve Your Content Creation Skills"},"https://tjtelan.com/blog/reflections-after-2-months-of-live-coding/":{"body":"I started streaming on Twitch this summer. I have been streaming Rust development once a week.\nThe opportunity presented itself for reasons related to the current state of travel industries (and the economic consequences that followed). It has been an interesting learning experience. \nAfter experimenting with something, it’s always good to take time to stop and reflect on what has been successful and where there’s room for improvement. The time I’ve spent so far has been challenging and confusing – but also enjoyable. This post is for anyone interested in the experiences of a beginning streamer, or anyone considering dipping their toes into the Twitch pool.\nI’ll organize my reflections into 3 sections:\n\nThings completely in my control\nShort-term objectives that I can influence\nLong-term aspirations\n\nIf you’re interested how I got started, I wrote a post about it that you can check out!\nThings completely in my control🔗\nLike most things in life, there’s not much completely within my control. But I can tinker with my channel's look and feel, the time and duration I stream, and what I work on during each stream.\nContent🔗\nWorking on a project provides natural boundaries. Before beginning a stream, I don’t need to know 100% what I’m going to accomplish or how. But I’m more mentally present if I am not thinking too much about what I need to do next. To help with that, I like to plan a predetermined, single direction per stream. I choose a reasonably-sized goal to work on for each stream, and try to roughly break down the steps so I have a small map to follow during the stream.\nI also expose project management over stream (via Github projects), which keeps me focused on individual tasks and keeps my stream content on track.\nLearn from my mistake. If you cross-stream to YouTube, be mindful of Content ID. I experimented with background music and naively loaded up another YouTube steam for a short moment. Don’t do this! Pretty quickly it was automatically flagged. Look for royalty-free music instead.\nViewer experience🔗\nAs I’ve continued on, I've put more effort into improving the experience of viewing my stream These are my key takeaways:\nKnow your limits. I’ve learned that 3 hours is about my maximum session length. Any longer and I start to feel low energy and my voice gets tired from all the talking. Not to mention, my current viewership and audience engagement doesn't justify being online for that long.\nShow your process. There are two steps (where I’m not actively coding) that I include on my stream as part of my process: diagrams and project management. \n\nWriting code is a lot of effort, especially if you don’t know where you’re going. For me, drawing out diagrams of structures or algorithms is like writing an outline before I start coding. I’ve been learning Figma to make nice diagrams for streams.\nIf I’m practicing project management, I’ll do it live. Lately, I’ve been using Github projects to manage my roadmap and planning.\n\nThis is an opportunity to show real parts of my process, and there’s no reason to hide that from viewers. \nIf you don’t know, now you know. If I don’t know something, I'll open a browser and look up documentation and examples or ask my viewers. It won’t benefit anyone if I’m just struggling. Plus, sometimes the audience can help out . Looking for answers is also a very normal part of coding – no one knows everything, and searching for things effectively is a skill in and of itself.\nTalk it out. It takes some practice, but speaking out my thought process has definitely  from when I first started. I realized as I was watching other live-coding streamers for research that it’s not exactly interesting to watch in silence as someone types. People usually will help if they know what you're trying to figure out, or ask questions to feel involved.\nDon’t stress. I also found it helpful to turn off the viewers count if you have the stream manager open. It serves no real time purpose and causes unnecessary mental stress if you're alone in your stream. Always talk like someone is watching.\nBack in five. Have OBS scenes to switch to for bathroom breaks or intentional moments away from the keyboard.  I think this is just polite as a non-gamer stream. It’s a bit of a bummer to open up a stream to an empty chair and no indication of when the person will be coming back.\nShort-term objectives I can influence🔗\nI have set a few new long-term goals for myself. But I'll always need to deal with the same obstacles to broadcasting effectively, and get viewers to agree to hang out and talk to me.\nAsking myself questions first🔗\nPractice makes perfect. If you are going to be exploring a new library on your stream, then practice using it for a non-trivial amount of time prior to broadcast. This will serve the purpose of defining a direction for the stream, in addition to building familiarity of where some of the pitfalls are in case of roadblocks. Having some familiarity with the tools or systems I’m working with also makes me feel more confident in demonstrating it, even when I don’t know how to do everything I plan on doing.\n&lt;human&gt; has entered the chat. People who chat will often not talk about the code you're writing. This isn't a negative! People usually just want to get to know me. Keep in mind, Twitch is not a lecture hall (unless that’s actually what your stream actually is).\nYes, it can feel a little disruptive to your train of thought if you’re only prepared to talk about what you’re working on. But that's another reason why to prepare with a plan and practice with any new tools.\nReaching an audience🔗\nOn Twitch. Twitch does little to promote for you as a small streamer. So experimenting with self-promotion is a must.\nThe lack of promotion can be a double-edged sword, compared to YouTube. The requirements for Twitch Affiliate are more modest but still take effort. \nOn YouTube. YouTube technically promotes you through search results, but I still need to experiment with self-promotion. The bar for reaching YouTube Partner is significantly higher. It definitely requires a different strategy to build an audience than Twitch. I am not actively focused on building my audience here... I just use Restream.io to simultaneously go live on YouTube and Twitch.\nLong-term aspirations🔗\nTruthfully, I don’t have any desire to make a living as a full-time streamer. However, I would like to have diverse sources of income, including anything I can make through streaming and anything I create while streaming. So for that reason alone, it makes it feel more important to take this a little seriously so that I will be able to meet the requirements for Twitch Affiliate.\nTwitch-specific channel improvements🔗\nIf I look at the more successful live-coding streamers, they have been on Twitch for a while, they’ve put some effort in their visual branding, and they are on a Twitch team. I believe that these are all realistically achievable for me if I put in the work. Here are improvements I am actively planning or working on:\n\nVisual improvements to my OBS scenes\nMaking my Twitch profile more interesting\nComing up with project ideas that are interesting and/or novel\nDetermining what time of day to start my stream, so people are more likely to stop by and stick around for a while\nReaching the requirements for Twitch Affiliate\nJoining a team: my goal is to join the Rustaceans Twitch team once I reach Affiliate status.\n\nNetworking🔗\nI stated before that Twitch doesn’t do much to promote small streamers. Promotion seems to be geared toward creators who are already reaching an audience. Networking is a creative skill I get to build that wouldn’t normally present itself in the Software industry in this capacity. It will certainly benefit me outside the context of streaming. Here are a few paths for networking:\nPre-stream promotion. It can be hard to find the appropriate venue for pre-stream promotion. I’ve personally found that Twitter is not a great place to promote if you don’t have an existing audience. My engagement is very low on my tweets for good reason. But it isn’t the only option I have. \nFind an audience by being active in communities. I wasn’t really watching other live-coding streams on Twitch prior to doing it myself, but I have noticed that I learn a lot by watching other streamers that are about the same size as myself or larger and taking note of what they do “right”. As well as interacting with them and their audience.\nOne nice surprise was finding that there are a lot of small channel live-coders or Rust language enthusiasts like me who show up in my chat to talk, and I’ve been able to make some connections this way.\nI’m also working on being a more active member of the Rust community. I’ve been using this language for a while. I don’t consider myself an expert, but I do feel like the community can benefit from  my voice and experience.\nTalk to the people around me. I hear that Seattle has a pretty active tech scene (For reasons, I need to state that this is a joke).\nLeveling up🔗\nThis is a bit of my insecurity presenting itself. But I notice improvements the longer I continue, which encourages me to keep going. I hope to:\n\nImprove my skill as someone who can design, plan, and write code. Especially in the domains I spend the most time in: Rust, Python, and Javascript.\nCome to terms with my self-consciousness about not being “a good programmer”.\nWrite more blog posts(I’m near the end of this one. It gets easier the more I do it.)\nProducing videos for YouTube as companions to blog posts\n\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading!\nI could not have predicted where I’d be this year. It has not shaped up to be anywhere near what I thought it might be. But I am fortunate that I was able to try something I would have normally not done before.\nIf you’re interested in how my story continues to procedurally generate, follow me on Twitch.\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/tjtelan\n","description":"Sharing thoughts, experiences, and goals about live-coding Rust on Twitch","id":"https://tjtelan.com/blog/reflections-after-2-months-of-live-coding/","path":"/blog/reflections-after-2-months-of-live-coding/","title":"Reflections after 2 months of live coding"},"https://tjtelan.com/blog/rust-2021/":{"body":"I missed the official call for blog post submissions, I still want to share some ramblings of my hopes for Rust in 2021.\nI’ll split this up into two sections: What I hope to see from the community, and what I hope to see for myself.\nWhat I want for the Rust community in 2021🔗\nI want to see Rust shed some of its reputation for being hard to learn🔗\nWhen I was learning Rust, I thought it was harder than necessary. But I would admit that it was due to writing strict idiomatic Rust while I was still figuring out how to be productive.\nI think learners should give themselves patience to learn Rust by writing bad or mediocre code first, and focus productivity later.\nI am not exactly sure how to create the conditions for this outcome. Maybe more people can publish more Rust that looks messy but “just works”.\nI know that Rust in Action is being written and it is for an intermediate-level audience. But perhaps this looks more like encouragement to beginners to ignore the warnings from the compiler. Just write Rust code and form your own opinions.\nMore blog posts from developers and management using Rust at work🔗\nFor 2021, I don’t even care if it is from one of the many blockchain-related companies using Rust. I want to read more experiences that lay out the decision of why Rust was chosen and how the experience has been.\nI am especially interested when expertise is in another language and a comparison can be made to the other language. Emphasis when performing a rewrite.\n\nExample: https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/rewriting-the-heart-of-our-sync-engine\n\nIt’s great to hear Rust used in complicated, low-level development, but it would be normalizing to read about more trivial types of applications, just as a way to highlight Rust as being good for general purpose use.\nAnecdotally, I feel like Go has been growing a reputation as being suitable as a scripting language kind for a while and Rust could also check many of the same boxes.\nMore Rust in DevOps tooling🔗\nIn my experience, the cultures surrounding Rust and DevOps are very similar. They both seem to attract cult-like appeal that demand adopters to adjust to thinking in a different way than they may have been taught.\nThe intended reasons are for a “better future experience” that usually alludes to improved cooperation at a non-technical level.\nThe implementations of Rust or DevOps shift considerations of future problems earlier in development. Possibly experiencing some of the friction earlier.\nRust’s benefits are often placed in a context of pure development benefit, which may be ok for now given it is primarily Devs that are writing code. But as a user, there are a few tools in the space that I’m aware of that support DevOps culture (e.g. Habitat, Linkerd) and I want to see more of them.\n\nLink regarding rise of Rust + DevOps: https://d2iq.com/blog/rust-devops \n\nBetter Rust Interoperability between languages🔗\nRust is entering other ecosystems through libraries via FFI. People don’t even have to know or care if they are using Rust. \nHowever, if I’m writing the code myself, it would be nice if FFI were done without needing to be so mindful of C as the common language.\nC++ and Java come to mind as currently Rust interop is a complicated dance. Rust to Javascript is improving through the Deno runtime, or through WebAssembly.\nMy motivation is that I’d like to work in the ecosystems where these languages are most often used (Web, Mobile and Embedded), but I stubbornly want to use Rust as much as possible.\nMore shared experiences from people picking up Rust as a second language.🔗\nThe borrow checker has a reputation that scares people away.\nEspecially if they are not from a traditional CS/Engineering background. And we should be trying to bring these folks into the ecosystem.\nAcceptance of Rust as another language worth knowing by “average devs” would be helped with more beginners writing or talking about it. It’s my observation that a lot of developers who are self-taught or from bootcamps are mostly in the Javascript/Python/Ruby space for mostly Web facing code. But Rust can be a perfect second language to learn about types and memory management.\nI believe content from this crowd would be my favorites to read since I think they’ll give valid opinions to someone who has been using Rust for years (like me) now overlook or accept without second thoughts.\nIncrease of copy/paste templates to help bootstrap common types of projects🔗\nI have just become aware of cargo generate because of some of the niche project spaces I’m working on: WebAssembly and embedded.\nToday, I keep my own repo where I offer rough working examples using common servers or patterns.\nMy technical wishlist🔗\n\nRust analyzer support for generated code\n\nI want support for Tonic’s generated code\n\n\nBetter tools or patterns for debugging Async/Await\n\nThe debugger just makes me realize how little I understand about Futures.\n\n\nNative Rust for building games\n\nThe end goal being Rust on consoles or in AAA games. I know they are sometimes used through FFI. It’s not a light task to use Rust in this manner.\n\n\nNative Rust for building mobile apps\n\nWe can technically write apps for both Android and iOS today, but they aren’t exactly popular because building is complicated\n\n\n\nWhere I plan to be with Rust in 2021🔗\nI plan to write more Rust that other people find useful.🔗\n\nI hope to have OrbitalCI into more of a Beta quality, and usable by others for feedback\nPublish more crates that allow people to write Rust to interact with existing APIs\n\nI plan to have serious projects🔗\nA few serious projects in upcoming Rust niches so that I can produce more educational content (and hopefully even a product that others may use!)\n\nEmbedded\nWebAssembly\nMobile\n\nI plan to start making money with Rust.🔗\n\nI’ve started my own business in 2020, and I’m not yet making any money. However, I’ve decided to base a lot of my work using Rust. I am enjoying the experience so far. I intend to sharpen my skills throughout 2021 into paid work.\nI hope to make some income through Twitch from livestreaming my coding and other platforms from my writing.\n\nHow do I intend to help the Rust project?🔗\n\nI’m using Rust to build software for my business (in the DevOps tooling space).\nI will be producing more blog posts, with an angle of inviting Python and Javascript programmers to Rust\nI plan on making my first code or docs contribution to the Rust project in 2021.\n\nConclusion🔗\nI see a lot of promise in Rust's future in 2021. Much has become stable in 2020 and all that is needed is some time and encouragement.\nI have enough confidence that I plan on using Rust as my main language as well as motivation to get more involved with the community.\n","description":"My response for this year's call for blog posts for the 2021 roadmap","id":"https://tjtelan.com/blog/rust-2021/","path":"/blog/rust-2021/","title":"Rust in 2021"},"https://tjtelan.com/blog/rust-custom-test-harness/":{"body":"\nThis is a post I wrote for Fluvio's blog\nCheck out Fluvio on Github\nI've posted here for archival purposes.\n\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        \n\nI ran into a problem effectively using cargo test in Fluvio for integration testing.\nLet’s talk about integration testing in Rust🔗\nWhile creating integration testing for Fluvio, I ran into a problem. Organizing and executing integration tests with cargo test was becoming inefficient. We needed to standardize the setup of a test environment. \nAs a lone developer, you can apply one-off customizations when running tests locally. But if you try to extend that strategy to continuous integration, you’ll quickly find that making changes manually becomes burdensome. CI encourages testing many different configurations, which means a successful CI plan requires easy management of test harness variables (a.k.a. Not manually updating variables for every test you need to run).\ncargo test is just not equipped to handle this specialized focus on environment setup, or the cleanup/teardown needed after a test is run. When using cargo test, these crucial tasks could only occur outside of the harness or within the logic of a test. Neither of these are good choices. Outside of the harness is not ideal because these processes end up too disconnected and hard to maintain. Likewise, including setup/teardown within the logic of a test is inappropriate because it creates mental overhead for a test writer, and may obscure the results of tests.\nI needed to find a way around the limited functionality of cargo test -- keep reading to find out how I did it by creating a standardized setup and teardown as part of our testing harness.\nHow does cargo test work by default?🔗\nThere is a distinction between unit tests and integration tests in the Rust book. The distinction is less about testing strategy and more about defining Rust’s conventions for test organization.\nThe main points are that:\n\nYour tests are annotated with #[test]\nlibtest harness enumerates through all of your tests (a point we’ll revisit later in more detail)\nlibtest returns the pass/fail status of the execution\n\nWhat do I need from integration testing?🔗\nLibtest doesn't specifically offer anything to support integration testing patterns.\nSetup of a standard test environment – especially in a complex system – is essential for managing expected behavior when making code changes.\nUnfortunately libtest does not assist with setup or teardown. I needed the ability to abstract away the setup and teardown of my test environment from test code. \nThis task will be performed either way. Without harness support, setup/teardown will be performed via external shell scripts or padding the setup/teardown process within every single integration test... (no one's idea of fun).\nIt isn’t convenient to manage setup and teardown in a different context than the integration test. This kind of testing overhead leads to hard-to-reproduce and time consuming mistakes.\nWhere do we get started with a custom test harness?🔗\nBy default, libtest will compile each of your #[test] labeled functions into their own binary crates (with its own main()) and executes it as part of the test. But we’re going to build all our integration tests into a single crate. This is recommended in order to speed up compile time ([1], [2])\nFirst we’re going to create an integration test directory at the root of the crate where we’re going to build our integration test focused binary.\n$ mkdir integration\n$ touch integration/main.rs\n\n# Then create a main() function in main.rs\n\nIn your Cargo.toml, you want to add \n# Cargo.toml\n\n# We'll revisit the `inventory` crate later in the post\n[dev-dependencies]\ninventory = \"0.1\"\n\n[[test]]\nname = \"integration\"\npath = \"integration/main.rs\"\nharness = false\n\nThis tells cargo test to not use libtest when running the integration test.\nWhen we run cargo test integration, what cargo will compile integration/main.rs and execute it in the same manner as cargo run. This is all a harness is from cargo’s perspective. \nAdd Setup and teardown steps🔗\nNext we’ll lay the foundation for our testing pattern. We’ll create 2 functions, setup() and teardown(), and add them to our main() (with reserved space in between for our future tests to be called).\n// main.rs\n\nfn setup() {\n   println!(\"Setup\")\n}\n\nfn teardown() {\n   println!(\"Teardown\")\n}\nfn main() {\n   // Setup test environment\n   setup();\n\n   // TODO: Run the test\n\n   // Teardown test environment\n   teardown();\n}\n\nCollect all integration tests🔗\nTo do its job, our test runner needs to create a list of all the test functions. Initially, I thought there would be an easy way to do this by leveraging libtest's #[test] attribute. \nI dug around in relevant areas of libtest and Cargo test and Rustc macros code, but long (sad) story short, there is no straightforward way to reuse libtest for the purpose of test collection.\nIf that surprises you, then you're like me. I had hoped to use the test collection functionality from #[test], but it wasn’t clear how I could accomplish this. My mental model for how cargo test works needed a refresh.\nNow that we’ve removed the option of using libtest, so that gives you 2 practical options for collecting tests:\n\nManually modify integration/main.rs and add your test in between the setup and teardown\n\nA quick and straightforward solution if you have a small set of tests\nThis option requires us to add new tests to this list, which can be error-prone and tedious as we grow.\n\n\nBuild a test collector. We generate an external test catalog, and modify integration/main.rs to execute tests from the catalog.\n\nThis is a long term solution, which we’ll be covering for the rest of the post.\n\n\n\nBuilding the test collector🔗\nFor this test collector, we'll be utilizing a crate. The inventory crate is a plugin registry system. We'll be using it for all the heavy lifting in our test framework, which means we'll be treating our tests as plugins.\nIn our main.rs, let’s declare a new module tests, where we can organize all the integration tests.\n// main.rs\n\n+ pub mod tests;\n\nfn setup() {\n   println!(\"Setup\")\n}\n\nfn teardown() {\n   println!(\"Teardown\")\n}\nfn main() {\n   // Setup test environment\n   setup();\n\n   // TODO: Run the test\n\n   // Teardown test environment\n   teardown();\n}\n\nIn our new module, we’ll start by creating a struct to represent a single test for the plugin registry.\n// tests/mod.rs\n\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub struct IntegrationTest {\n   pub name: &amp;'static str,\n   pub test_fn: fn(),\n}\n\ninventory::collect!(IntegrationTest);\n\nIn this example, our struct IntegrationTest has 2 fields. \n\nname is a human-readable name, which can be used as a key for test selection.\ntest_fn is a pointer to a function whose signature is non-async, takes no args, and does not return anything.\n\nNote:  You can use functions that take args, and return things.\nFor example:\npub test_fn: fn(String) -&gt; Result&lt;(), ()&gt;,\n\nThen we call the inventory::collect!()macro to instantiate a plugin registry. When we write our tests, we’ll add to the plugin registry. More on this next.\nAdding new tests to plugin registry🔗\nWe’re going to add a new basic test to the plugin registry. Start by adding a new submodule called basic in the tests module. \n// tests/mod.rs\n\npub mod basic;\n\nIn the basic module, we write our basic test basic_test()\n// tests/basic.rs\n\nuse super::IntegrationTest;\n\nfn basic_test() {\n   println!(\"Running basic test\")\n}\n\ninventory::submit!(IntegrationTest {\n   name: \"basic\",\n   test_fn: basic_test\n});\n\nWe'll use inventory::submit!() to register our new test with the IntegrationTest struct we defined earlier.\nname is a friendly, human-readable name. We can use this name as a key to search through the plugin registry.\ntest_fn takes the name of our test function. It has the same function signature as we defined. \nRunning tests from registry🔗\nWe’ll finish this example up by running all of our registered tests\n// main.rs\n\npub mod tests;\n+ use tests::IntegrationTest;\n\nfn setup() {\n   println!(\"Setup\")\n}\n\nfn teardown() {\n   println!(\"Teardown\")\n}\nfn main() {\n   setup();\n\n-   // TODO: Run the test\n+   // Run the tests\n+   for t in inventory::iter::&lt;IntegrationTest&gt; {\n+       (t.test_fn)()\n+   }\n\n   teardown();\n}\n\n$ cargo test integration\n   Compiling blog-post-example v0.1.0 (/home/telant/Documents/blog-post-example)\n\tFinished test [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.21s\n \tRunning target/debug/deps/blog_post_example-e042d787684bb333\n\nrunning 0 tests\n\ntest result: ok. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s\n\n \tRunning target/debug/deps/integration-7ed2452642c6f3b6\n\nSetup\nRunning basic test\nTeardown\n\nTips for extending the example🔗\nThe example runs all of the registered tests. But here are some useful impls if you want to extend even further. For example, adding a CLI, if you want to select individual tests. Or provide options to customize setup or teardown behavior.\nimpl IntegrationTest {\n   pub fn all_test_names() -&gt; Vec&lt;&amp;'static str&gt; {\n       inventory::iter::&lt;IntegrationTest&gt;\n           .into_iter()\n           .map(|x| x.name)\n           .collect::&lt;Vec&lt;&amp;str&gt;&gt;()\n   }\n\n   pub fn from_name&lt;S: AsRef&lt;str&gt;&gt;(test_name: S) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;'static IntegrationTest&gt; {\n       inventory::iter::&lt;IntegrationTest&gt;\n           .into_iter()\n           .find(|t| t.name == test_name.as_ref())\n   }\n}\n\n\nIf you want to see more of these ideas extended even further, check out Fluvio’s integration test runner.\nWe use the CLI to customize setup, handle async testing, and we use an attribute macro to collect tests.\n\nConclusion🔗\nRust’s testing ecosystem in the 2018 edition is great for unit testing. But for integration testing it still has room for improvement. Custom harnesses will become more necessary as Rust gains new developers. \nIf we want to avoid reinventing the wheel, we need stable support from libtest or more examples of how to perform test collection and patterns for setup, test, and teardown workflows.\nIf you made it this far, thank you for following along with me!

(A habit I picked up in school from the Electrical Engineering side of my formal education.) I've written an entry for (almost) every day working.\nThere are a few reasons why this has been my preference to text-based note taking, for example: a simple text file, or more complex, a wiki\nLow-tech solution for a low-tech problem🔗\nIf I need to write a to-do list, or a reminder for myself while I'm away from my desk, it is a lot easier to jot something down and be done. I don't require to be near a text-editor. I don't need to create a wiki page, or do any post-markup to what I've written.\nAlso, I'm free to use a page however I need to in order to get my thought onto the page. I'm not limited to software features for my visual metaphors if I'm sketching out a diagram, or using common symbols\nThe downsides🔗\nThis approach has bitten me a few times. When I've started in with a new notebook in the middle of a project (since bound books have limited pages) I'm stuck carrying 2 books for a while.\nText searching features don't exist in my books. At least not without scanning and OCR (Making the assumtion that my handwriting is neat enough to be read into a text form, which is an unrealistic assumption.)\nLooking for a balance🔗\nIt got me thinking about what I needed to do if I wanted to go all digital with my note taking, but keep my workflow intact.\nThe feeling of using a softer tip on a phone screen requires too much of a change to how I naturally write. I end up concentrating more just to make sure I write legibly enough for myself. Recently, I bought a hard-tipped stylus for my phone, since my experiences with other rubber tipped styli were underwhelming. An argument can be made about the price for a good styli. The good reviews start at about $20-30. A large commitment for an instrument that is only good on touch screens.\nI use an Android phone, and, at least at the time of this writing, there aren't a lot of great hand writing tools. Most are marketed towards the digital artist. Lots of authoring features I don't need, and some that are missing for creating journal entries.\nFiinote so far has been my favorite. I get a good mix of hand-written options, hand-drawn, text-based. And I can create hyperlinks, and embed images if I choose to. It has only been a few days, but if the free version is this great, the obvious choice may be to support the developers by upgrading to the full version.\nConclusion🔗\nI recommend writing your notes down. There have been many articles and studies about the cognitive advantages of longhand vs keyboarding for note taking.\nHard-tipped styli are pretty great, and cost about as much as nicer ink pens (~$25-100+).\nGood, free software for handwriting exists for handwriting.

Also, I noticed that I've just been resisting basically any upgrades to the OS to the point where I've only been running the LTS versions to guarantee that I wouldn't lose hardware and power saving support after an upgrade (probably a little irrational).\nI've been migrating off of the default Ubuntu install for a while now, and I just want a little more control.

Now back to your regularly scheduled program...\n\n\nThis is a summary of my experience with writing a Rust DB-backed server/client with grpc-rs to communicate to the backend, and Diesel as an ORM to be used with PostgreSQL.\nWhat did I want out of this exercise?🔗\nI don't consider myself an expert with Rust, also not a beginner. I've been following the Rust language development for a while. I also have been wanting to move from writing code for personal projects to writing for work projects. \nI have the privilege to choose the tools I want at work, but I must keep in mind that I don't work by myself. I need to be able to provide practical development advice and enough technical mentorship to my teammates to keep us all productive.\nKevin Hoffman’s blog post let me know that what I wanted was possible today in stable (as opposed to nightly). Kevin’s post is great, but I couldn’t really absorb it my first few reads, because he is a more experienced Rust developer than myself. I didn't quite understand the code in his post, and I couldn’t appreciate details he skimmed over which I will point out. I hope that I can provide supplemental details.\nMy target🔗\nI am looking to build a very basic command line interface client, and a backend service. The cli communicates to the backend via gRPC, and the backend connects to a database.\ngRPC\nBased on Kevin Hoffman's experience, and the download activity on crates.io, I also used Pingcap's library grpc-rs. However, while writing this post tower-rs (which is a pure Rust implementation) is considered to be stable, though may not yet implement all features.\nDatabase\nFor database, I decided to use Diesel-rs since there really aren’t any other choices that I felt were better in a production environment. Diesel is a mature project that is very actively supported.\nCommand line interface\nFor the command line interface, I picked clap-rs, because I was interested in trying out defining the command line content and structure with yaml. In the future I would probably use StructOpt. It happens to use clap-rs internally, but the written code is easier for me to read, and in my opinion, less code to write derives. For this reason, I’ll probably gloss over the command line implementation. It provides the minimal amount of interaction I needed to highlight what appears to be an idiomatic pattern. \nAfter spending a few hours with all the tools, I wanted to jump in feet first with an example project.\nMy first attempt figuring out my development pattern🔗\nI briefly considered not telling the parts of the story where I was figuring out how to get everything to compile but here it is. It ended up being a big learning experience. I won't get into super deep detail about my intentions since I ended up not going in this direction. But I will highlight what I learned.\nI focused on individually building with Diesel and gRPC. Once I felt ready to do something productive with these crates, I started thinking about implementation by designing the protocol buffers first, and designing the database later. This ended up being a time-expensive mistake that hopefully will not need to repeated, dear Reader.\nRed flags in the workflow🔗\nI am generating my proto Rust code from .proto using grpc-rs in my build.rs. It runs during cargo build. Based on Diesel's getting started guide, I expected that I would be annotating my proto Rust with the same #[derive()]. \nBut If I'm going to be using the generated structs w/ Diesel, then I have to break up the protobuf compilation w/ some manual step to additionally add in the correct annotations, because the next cargo build regenerated code and removed my manual changes. This was a red flag, but I kept moving forward anyway...\nDiesel also expects that your struct fields are 1:1 with your table schema for to use the custom  #[Derive(Queryable)] for querying the DB. If you haven't looked at grpc-rs generated grpc code, you'll see extra internally used struct fields: unknown_fields and cached_size. These are part of grpc-rs’s implementation of message serialization/deserialization. Moving forward could require representing these extra fields in the database, which has a bad smell and is wasteful of space. \nExample of grpc-rs generated Rust code w/ the special fields\n#[derive(PartialEq,Clone,Default)]\npub struct OrderForm {\n    // message fields\n    pub quantity: i32,\n    pub product: OilProductType,\n    // special fields\n    pub unknown_fields: ::protobuf::UnknownFields,\n    pub cached_size: ::protobuf::CachedSize,\n}\n\n\nChoosing to work directly with this generated struct means manually modifying the list of derive() and working around the special fields unknown_fields and cached_size so Diesel could still be used inserts and queries. Possibly requiring adding columns in the table schema. This is a more tight coupling than I want between my protobuf library and the data in the database.\n\nWhat I should have done🔗\nI only realized this after writing the client/server using the raw proto structs. I then moved onto designing the db schema and migrations. I got stuck trying to flow the grpc client calls to db inserts.\nI concluded that I would need to create new structs that only Diesel would use since their support heavily relies on Derive code. It all felt like an impedance mismatch, and I was having to redo the same work over again without a clear path for where I was going.\nThis was a failure. If I could work backwards from the database inserts to the protos, then this might work out better for my understanding.\nMy second approach🔗\nBefore implementation🔗\nI'm still learning how to write idiomatic Rust. When I got my protos compiling into generated Rust code, and assumed I needed to use it directly because it is native code, despite my unfamiliarity with all of the code generated by Pingcap’s gRPC library.\n\nI’m relying heavily on the use of the Into trait to create a little anti-corruption layer so that the business logic on both my client and my server are not operating directly on the protobuf-generated structs. -- Kevin Hoffman\n\nAfter a not-skimmed reading of Kevin's Hoffman's post, I noticed he described using this same approach in a hand-wavey manner. I wasn't ready to appreciate the warning without some example code or a diagram.\nUse separate structs for business logic🔗\nI hadn’t immediately considered that I might want to write my own structs instead of using the protobuf-generated structs since my mindset was that the generated code would be ergonomic enough to use code.\nHowever, the strategy of using separate structs offers very easy to use conversions because of the From and Into traits. This would be easier for the maintainability and readability of my code because I can contain that conversion logic in away from my business logic.\nI could convert them back and forth between the protobuf-generated forms and the diesel supported forms with .into(). How is this achieved?\nMore on this during implementation...\nWhat is using this pattern like in the code?🔗\nAn example interaction would look like this\nInserts into the database - Client side:\n\nUser input \nCreate Diesel struct + any data manipulation \nConvert Diesel struct into Proto struct \nSend Proto struct in gRPC call\n\nInserts into the database - Server side:\n\nReceive Proto struct\nConvert Proto struct into Diesel struct + Any data manipulation\nInsert into DB\n\nThe Last complicated detail : Rust custom types mapping to Postgres Enums🔗\nI want to use Rust enums and Postgres enums to carry my usage of types all the way to DB insert/query. The diesel schema generator doesn't handle custom postgres enums well, but we can manage the conversion by hand by using a few Diesel Derives: SqlType, FromSql, and ToSql . I might cover using custom postgres types with Diesel in another post. But for now, I am going to hand-wave this detail.\nThe Diesel-rs custom types tests were very useful helping me figure it out.\nOrganizing code into cargo workspaces🔗\nWith some experience under my belt and a better understanding of where relative domains in the code should be separated by crate, I wanted to organize before writing new code. The first thing I did was separate the codebase into workspaces.\nSeparating into different crates would let me organize the struct conversion code from complicating the readability of the business logic code. This will make it easier to reuse patterns between the client and server side through importing the crates.\nImplementation🔗\nWrite database schema🔗\nBecause I need some kind of story to write code against, I decided to write an oil ordering system (because proto-diesel can be described as oil… har har…)\nMy postgres type oil_product has a pie chart of oil derived products that I got from the wiki page of Oil Refinery\nThat helped me with my first thing: I need my database schema - schema.rs\nThen I could write my migrations:\n\nup.sql\ndown.sql\n\nGet inserts into DB working🔗\nSecond is getting inserts into the db working on the backend - Link to specific commit\nbackend.rs\nThis is a simple call from the backend to an internal function that performs the DB insert. After opening a connection, I test create a hardcoded order.\n[...]\nlet conn = client::establish_connection();\nlet new_order = client::create_order(&amp;conn, 1, schema::OilProductEnum::DIESEL);\n[...]\n\ncreate_order\nThis insert only works once because the id is set to 1. But the result is in insert of an order into the database, and returning the inserted Order from the function. \npub fn create_order(conn : &amp;PgConnection, quantity : i32, product_type : OilProductEnum) -&gt; Order {\n    let new_order = vec![\n        Order {\n            id : 1,\n            quantity : quantity,\n            product_type : product_type,\n        },\n    ];\n\n    diesel::insert_into(orders::table)\n        .values(&amp;new_order)\n        .get_result(conn)\n        .expect(\"Error saving new order\")\n}\n\nCreating user input structs for business logic🔗\nI created some structs solely for taking user input. It will converted to a proto form that will be used for gRPC calls\nThese structs didn't include dynamic info like ids or timestamps, since those are generated right before insert on the server side.\nSeparate proto messages needed to be defined specifically for taking user input from the client-side.\nOne of the business logic structs\npub struct OrderForm {\n    pub quantity : i32,\n    pub product_type : OilProductEnum,\n}\n\nThe corresponding proto message definition\nmessage OrderForm {\n    int32 quantity = 2;\n    OilProductType product = 3;\n}\n\nConverting business logic struct to/from proto-generated struct🔗\nI implemented the From trait to convert my custom type to protobuf types for the grpc client calls (and vice-versa). The From trait gives us the Into implementation for free.\n// Convert from the protos to our type\nimpl From&lt;refinery::OrderForm&gt; for OrderForm {\n    fn from(proto_form : refinery::OrderForm) -&gt; Self {\n        OrderForm {\n            quantity : proto_form.get_quantity(),\n            product_type : OilProductEnum::from(proto_form.get_product()),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Convert from our type to the proto\nimpl From&lt;OrderForm&gt; for refinery::OrderForm {\n    fn from(rust_form : OrderForm) -&gt; Self {\n        let mut order = refinery::OrderForm::new();\n\n        order.set_quantity(rust_form.quantity);\n        order.set_product(refinery::OilProductType::from(rust_form.product_type));\n        order\n    }\n}\n\nSnippet from convert.rs:\nTake user input before making gRPC call🔗\nWe want to take user input from a client, make a grpc backend call, then insert into the db from the backend.\nWe already have taken care of converting to and from proto forms, so this is focused on control flow now.\nMove inserts into gRPC server endpoint🔗\nInsert will occur after calling into the grpc server endpoint from the client-side.\nOn the client-side, I created a protobuf-generated struct with default values, for demonstrating the gRPC call to the backend works. I can easily take user input afterwards.\nReceive proto struct and convert into DB insertable struct🔗\nLastly, I worked out taking in user input, and using it to instantiate one of my custom types. During the grpc backend call, I call .into() on my type, which will convert to the protobuf form. On the backend, I take in the request, and call .into() to convert back into my type so I can marshal into a diesel insert call.\nServer-side\nI'm converting the proto-form struct req into the business logic form OrderForm by calling .into(). Since the create_order() impl takes in OrderForm, there is no need to annotate the type with .into() and we’re able to stay focused.\n#[derive(Clone)]\nstruct RefineryService;\n\nimpl Refinery for RefineryService {\n    // The client-side converts to refinery::OrderForm while calling this endpoint.\n    // But we convert the proto type back to our custom type right before adding to the database\n    fn order(&amp;mut self, ctx: RpcContext, req: refinery::OrderForm, sink: UnarySink&lt;refinery::OrderStatus&gt;) {\n\n    // Creating the return object\n        let order_status = client::order_received_success();\n\n        let f = sink\n            .success(order_status.clone())\n            .map(move |_| println!(\"Responded with status {{ {:?} }}\", order_status))\n            .map_err(move |err| eprintln!(\"Failed to reply: {:?}\", err));\n\n        let conn = client::establish_connection();\n        // Convert the received proto request into our native type\n        let _new_order = client::create_order(&amp;conn, req.into());\n\n        ctx.spawn(f)\n    }\n}\n\nFunction for creating order\nWe take the business logic form order_form and use it to create the insertable struct new_order with all of the column values for Diesel to execute.\npub fn create_order(conn : &amp;PgConnection, order_form : OrderForm) -&gt; Order {\n    let timestamp = NaiveDateTime::from_timestamp(Utc::now().timestamp(),0);\n\n    let new_order = vec![\n        NewOrder {\n            quantity : order_form.quantity,\n            product_type : order_form.product_type,\n            received_time : timestamp,\n        },\n    ];\n\n    diesel::insert_into(orders::table)\n        .values(&amp;new_order)\n        .get_result(conn)\n        .expect(\"Error saving new order\")\n}\n\nDo it again, in reverse, for queries🔗\nLast task to cover is repeating all of this work, but for making queries.\nThis ended up being slightly off pattern from implementing From traits, because I am returning a list of Orders, and the From trait apparently is not easily implemented for a Vec to the protobuf Rust equivilent. If I were planning on shipping this code somewhere other than for demonstration, I probably would spend more time implementing From. I ended up getting lazy, and wrapped the manual conversion in a function that loops and uses my already implemented From traits on the Order type. \nuser input side\nThis client subcommand from the cli requests all of the orders from the database, then prints out the protobuf form as a demonstration. The next step would be converting the protobuf list into a Vec of some non-protobuf generated type.\nif let Some(_matches) = matches.subcommand_matches(\"summary\") {\n    let empty_payload = protos::empty::Empty::new();\n\n    // Send the gRPC message\n    let orders = client.get_all_records(&amp;empty_payload).expect(\"RPC Failed!\");\n\n    // Print all records from database\n    println!(\"Order status: {:?}\", orders);\n}\n\nserver endpoint\nThe server takes in an empty proto type, so we don’t have to do any type conversions. We then call a function client::get_all_orders() that calls Diesel to return all the data in a table. Then we make another function call client::db_query_to_proto() to convert our native data into a gRPC sendable form.\nfn get_all_records(&amp;mut self, ctx: RpcContext, _req: protos::empty::Empty, sink: UnarySink&lt;refinery::OrderRecordList&gt;){\n    println!(\"Received request for all of the order records\");\n    let conn = client::establish_connection();\n\n    // Call out to db\n    let query_results = client::get_all_orders(&amp;conn);\n\n    // This conversion pattern is different than the plain `From` traits, because we\n    // have to handle the outer vector in a special way, but I want to be lazy\n    let parsed_query_proto = client::db_query_to_proto(query_results);\n    //println!(\"Got results from the database: {:?}\", query_results);\n\n    let f = sink\n        .success(parsed_query_proto.clone())\n        .map(move |_| println!(\"Responded with list of records {{ {:?} }}\", parsed_query_proto))\n        .map_err(move |err| eprintln!(\"Failed to reply: {:?}\", err));\n\n    ctx.spawn(f)\n}\n\ndatabase query\nThis function queries for everything in the orders table. There's nothing interesting here because Diesel handles everything. I just needed to annotate the type of vector that Diesel was going to return.\n// get_all_orders is used by the backend\npub fn get_all_orders(conn : &amp;PgConnection) -&gt; Vec&lt;Order&gt; {\n    let query : Vec&lt;Order&gt; = orders::table.select(orders::all_columns)\n    .order_by(orders::id)\n    .load(conn)\n    .expect(\"Error getting all order records\");\n    query\n}\n\nquery to protobuf list\nYou don't need to use all of the Rust features all up front or not use Rust at all. We can all hopefully appreciate that this can still be understood.\nI briefly tried to implement From for Vec&lt;Order&gt;, but it became evident that it was going to take a little more effort than I was willing to spend at this moment. I'm first to admit that this is a bit of a hack, but that's fine for demonstration purposes. \nProtobuf's repeated keyword in the Rust code has its own type like Vec&lt;T&gt; called RepeatedField and we are simply looping through and creating a Vec&lt;refinery::OrderRecord&gt; so we could use the conversion impl from_vec. The rest is for building the return data.\n// db_query_to_proto is used by the backend to convert a Vector of Order (from a Diesel select\n// query) into the proto native OrderRecordList. Implementing `From` for a Vector would have taken\n// longer, and used a wrapper type. That very well may be the more maintainable approach, but this\n// was quicker…\n\npub fn db_query_to_proto(rust_record : Vec&lt;Order&gt;) -&gt; refinery::OrderRecordList {\n    let mut proto_vec : Vec&lt;refinery::OrderRecord&gt; = Vec::new();\n\n    // Let's take advantage of the `From` trait\n    for r in rust_record {\n        proto_vec.push(refinery::OrderRecord::from(r));\n    }\n\n    let proto_order = protobuf::RepeatedField::from_vec(proto_vec);\n\n    let mut proto_final = refinery::OrderRecordList::new();\n    proto_final.set_order(proto_order);\n    proto_final\n}\n\nIn conclusion🔗\nRust library support for gRPC is here. ORM support with Diesel-rs has been here for a while. But if you want to use gRPC and Diesel in the same project, maybe you can learn from my experience and be productive.\nDo not primarily use the protobuf generated Rust types throughout your codebase. Especially if you plan on using Diesel-rs to deal with database inserts/queries, because structs need to be 1:1 with your table schema for the smoothest experience using Diesel-rs.\nImplement the From/Into traits to more effectively convert between business logic structs and your protobuf generated Rust structs.\nConvert to the proto Rust types only to send/return data over gRPC calls and then immediately convert back to your business logic type on the receiving end.\nYou don't need to write perfect Rust code in one go.\n\nThe code used throughout this post is located here.\n","description":"A demonstration of a Rust CLI application using GRPC and PostgreSQL","id":"https://tjtelan.com/blog/using-a-database-grpc-with-rust/","path":"/blog/using-a-database-grpc-with-rust/","title":"Using a database + gRPC with Rust"},"https://tjtelan.com/blog/virtualbox-headless-mode-on-windows-7/":{"body":"An impromptu reformat of my Windows 7 machine quickly had me frustrated with Virtualbox reconfiguration. It had been so long since I had originally done it, and I had forgotten to document the nuances of that setup. So here goes:\nPurpose🔗\nThis specific VM configuration is FreeBSD 8.2 w/ ZFS on root. I don't have the time to set it up from scratch, but I'm currently using the newest ZFS version available on this site (v28, special edition).\nI'm only planning on using this VM for SSH for a persistent irc connection. I also want this to start automatically at Win7's boot.\nInstall VM🔗\nSo after installing FreeBSD and ports and of course, remembering to ENABLE SSH... I had to test the ssh connection.\n(Remember to open the ports on the host side.

A few people watched for a few minutes, so I considered it to be a success. I used what I already had on hand, did not spend any money and I was able to stream for about 3 hours from zero code to a small completed project. There is much room for improvement, but I want to share what I used to get started. \nMy motivation for streaming my coding sessions is to improve my communication skills, as well as educate and demonstrate to others about being productive with programming languages and tech that I like using.\nMy streaming setup🔗\nI’m running Linux on my System76 Gazelle laptop. My distro is Manjaro 20 (KDE Plasma).\nThe following are the hardware + software I already had\n\nLaptop webcam\nCondenser microphone (I use a Behringer C-1U)\nAdjustable mic stand\nExternal Monitor\nExternal keyboard\nExternal mouse\nStreaming software (I used OBS. More on that later)\nText editor (I used VSCode)\nTerminal (I used Alacritty + the built-in terminal in VSCode)\nWeb browser\n\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        My extra basic streaming setup. Don't spend big money before you even have momentum.\n\nSet accurate expectations for yourself and potential viewers🔗\nI watched a few coding streams from people that I see in the space regularly prior to running my own. I didn't want to reinvent the wheel, and so I had to experience what works for others and identify anything that is common. Pretty much no one is doing anything wholly unique, so I decided I would learn by copying what works for other coding streamers.\nCreate loose structure to guide you🔗\nWrite your title with intention🔗\nUnless you have an existing community, try to avoid low-value clickbait.\nAs a lowly unknown I need to bring a simple, but descriptive stream title. \nI want people to know:\n\nWhat language I'm writing in.\nWhat fancy technology I plan to use, if any.\nSuccinct objective (Emphasis on singular!)\n\nSomething to keep in mind: Titles get truncated at about 40 or so characters. After that, viewers will have to put in some effort to mouse over your title to read past the cut.\n\nThe title I settled on?\n[Rust] GRPC Remote Command Line using Tonic + CLAP - Writing a blog post\n\nAdd a description and have a plan🔗\nMost of the streamers have some narrow theme for their time online in order to set expectations for people watching.\nExplicitly let your viewers know what they are going to see in your description so they can decide if they will stick around. Otherwise you'll either get asked the same questions or people will just bounce out with disinterest.\n\nSpecific to my first stream:\nI wanted to dedicate time to writing the example Rust code for another blog post I have in progress.\nWith that in mind:\nDescription\n\nPrimary goal is to write a small CLI driven gRPC server/client in Rust\nSecondary goal is to document my process including looking up documentation and testing.\n\nPlan\n\nIn my notes, I broke down the domains of the application into ordered objectives I could follow.\nI would take on each domain one at a time with the intention of connecting each of them together as each section became stable enough to test with user input.\n\n\nTechnical preparation🔗\nSince I didn’t want to worry about getting everything perfect I narrowed my focus on a few details and personal preferences about the stream.\n\nNot streaming my entire desktop, instead individual windows.\n\n(I thought this would be easier for viewers.)\n\n\nIncluding a background for the negative space\nSmall on-screen banner that includes links to my other online platforms\n\nMinor self-promotion\n\n\nMicrophone only, no external music\nWebcam placement as close to level to or pointing down on my face\n\nSo people wouldn't have to look up my nose\n\n\n\nI didn't worry about having chat visible but I did have it open for me to interact with just in case.\nSet up streaming software🔗\nTwitch has a list of recommended software for broadcasting. I ended up using Open Broadcaster Software, more commonly known as OBS because it has support for Linux.\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        Open Broadcaster Software a.k.a OBS\n\nI’m not going to go over the deep details of OBS, but I encourage looking for tutorials on Youtube. Even in 2020, the beginner OBS tutorials from a few years ago are still relevant and usable. They helped make using OBS a lot less intimidating.\nEnable the preview and prepare to spend a little bit of time in OBS. What you see in the preview is what will get streamed out. Start simple. One Scene, and start with one source and add in sources as you get more familiar.\nQuick start guide to Sources🔗\nHere’s a short list of sources you may want to add from a Linux desktop into OBS and what they translate to to usable in OBS.\nDescription of inputOBS sourceNotes\nEntire desktopScreen Capture (XSHM)If you have multiple monitors, you will need to select the screen you want to display\nSpecific windowWindow Capture (XComposite)You’ll need to select the window you want displayed. One source per window\nImageImageTested w/ JPEG, PNG\nWebcamVideo Capture Device (V4L2)You’ll need to select your webcam from Devices if you have multiple cameras attached\nCapture CardVideo Capture Device (V4L2)Similar to webcam, you’ll need to select your capture card device. Especially if you also have a webcam attached to your computer\nMicrophone- Audio Capture Device (ALSA)- Audio Capture Input (PulseAudio)It might be easier to configure audio through: Settings &gt; Audio &gt; Devices  Especially if you want to disable sources\nDesktop audio- Audio Capture Device (ALSA)- Audio Capture Input (PulseAudio)(See notes for microphone)\n\nThis may slightly differ from what the official OBS Sources guide documents, but if you’re choosing to use Linux to stream then you probably already expect this. \n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        What OBS sources look like in Linux\n\nThe Sources &gt; Add drop-down menu has icons that give good hints for what they do. Your results may vary, so be prepared to play around with settings. (But you already know that if you're insisting on using Linux...)\nWorkarounds for blacked out screens using laptop hybrid GPU setups🔗\nOne issue I ran into while writing his guide was being unable to use a single window as a streaming source. Adding the source resulted in a window that was blacked out, but my mouse cursor was still visible when over the window.\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        VSCode's window is blacked out in OBS, but my cursor is still visible...\n\nTo work around, you can pick one of the following solutions:\n\nForce OBS and all your windows to run on the same GPU. Some software such as web browsers or IDEs use hardware acceleration by default. You can enable/disable accordingly to match OBS.\nOr you can restart your laptop in either integrated or GPU mode (i.e., not hybrid mode)\n\nThe reason is due to how hybrid GPU works. OBS and the window I was trying to display were running on different gpus. \nFor more information please read this thread from the OBS Project forums.\nConfiguring API keys for streaming🔗\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        OBS stream key settings\n\nThe location for where you add in your service stream key is very easy to navigate to:\nSettings &gt; Stream\nSelect the service you want to stream to, and enter the Stream Key.\nThere are many preconfigured services in OBS, so you’ll probably only need to provide your stream key and not the service URL.\nCommon links to where you can get your stream key:\n\nYoutube\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard\nStream name/key is at the button of the page\n\n\nTwitch\n\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/settings/profile -- Then click Channels and Videos\nOr: https://dashboard.twitch.tv/u/&lt;your-twitch-username&gt;/settings/channel\nPrimary Stream Key is listed at the top of the page\n\n\n\n(I use a service called Restream which is supported by OBS. Restream will broadcast to multiple services at the same time. I use it to broadcast to YouTube and Twitch simultaneously.)\nDon’t overthink and start streaming🔗\n \n    \n        \n    \n\n        Don't worry about perfection. Just take the first step and start.\n\nThe first thing I noticed after going live was that the platforms I was broadcasting to had some noticeable lag between my actions and seeing it live in the browser.\nWhen you first get started, you probably won’t have a lot of people watching. This will be a good thing because you’re going to notice many details you’ll want to improve. \nI'm saying this to myself for the benefit of anyone else who got this far:\nIt will take time, effort and consistency on your part before you see results. So relax, try to have fun and enjoy the process.\n\nIf you made this far, thanks!\nPlease check me out on my Twitch channel. I stream weekly coding sessions about using Rust and DevOps topics. I hope you'll considering following me!\n","description":"Streaming a coding session on Twitch using a Linux laptop was easier than expected.","id":"https://tjtelan.com/blog/what-i-learned-running-a-live-programming-stream-from-linux/","path":"/blog/what-i-learned-running-a-live-programming-stream-from-linux/","title":"What I learned running a live programming Twitch stream from Linux"},"https://tjtelan.com/blog/year-in-review-2024/":{"body":"I didn't want the whole year to go by without making at least a single post. To be honest, I’m really uneasy writing and editing, because of how long and unplanned my absence has been. I am still alive, and documenting my life because I want to. This is another year in review, 2024.\nProfessional changes🔗\nTldr; I am no longer working as a software dev. Goodbye tech and software dev for now.\nBeing a developer is the only profession I’ve known as an adult. It sucks to be a decade deep into a career only to realize that the big negative feelings after university and leading into my first job… they never go away. I had a lot of good moments of personal success and team camaraderie. But it was only a handful of moments - witnessing or experiencing heavy injustices…  These moments ultimately helped me decide to not return any time soon. Unless I have assurances it will not be a culture of zero-sum thinking, I would not even consider. In my experience, zero-sum thinking is the common ingredient that breeds toxic organizations and ultimately I lose interest and burn out.\nI asked myself if it is worth biding my time at this startup? It is exhausting working with people who act as if they are eagerly waiting for money to fall in their lap so they can begin to oppress others with their money. I didn’t need to decide. My layoff was callous and has left a scar on my psyche. \nSo what’s next? I think it’s mostly undecided. I want to take some creative risks that have been on the backburner, and develop my skill as a storyteller. I am certain that tech will play a smaller role in my identity going forward. I won’t continue to grow into the person I want to be unless I push development to the background. But fortunately, I am in no rush. \nI joined the board of my local makerspace as a director. This is an opportunity to cultivate the growth of those up incoming in their careers by providing an example of sustainable organization like I had when I first started. I will foster the current and future developers of this community with the skills and experience I have gained over the years. I want to improve communication around tech and make it accessible and less opaque. \nThe Eclipse trip🔗\nI've been obsessed since watching my first total solar eclipse during 2017 in Portland. My partner and I were commemorating this trip to my late dog, Fig, who was present with us at the Portland eclipse. It was a very important trip for me, so it made the travel issues at the start of the trip hurt a lot more. It threw off my focus for a few days.\nThe travel issues:\n\nThe flight was rough\n\nlanding took 3 attempts\nvomited during the last of the attempts bc of all the turbulence\n\n\nMy bag was stolen from the carousel\n\nMy travel gear and favorite clothes, collected over years were lost\nIrreplaceable, personal things were lost\nAmerican Airlines refused to reimburse me later, too!\nWeather was hot and dry, and I was unprepared\n\n\n\nThis was an American Airlines flight from Seattle to Charlotte, NC. My worst travel experience ever!\nHard lesson learned: \n\nNever trust the airlines with your belongings.\nDon’t travel with irreplaceable things, if possible!\n\nIf you must, keep it with you - do not check it!\n\n\n\nWe flew to North Carolina because we were road tripping with friends and staying at an Airbnb in Ohio to view the eclipse. Before the road trip started, we visited Carowinds and speed ran through a handful of the thriller roller coasters (twice through Fury 325!). This was a pretty decent followup after needing to buy clothes last minute.\nTrip started from our friend’s place in Charlotte to the Airbnb in Port Clinton, Ohio. It was my first time in this part of the country, and I had a good time with the little exposure I had. We took some detours, such as an escape room in Columbus. \nPlan was to arrive a day early, and then leave a day later - a precaution taken from post-eclipse in 2017 to avoid a really boring time in traffic. On the buffer day, we took a ferry to visit Kerry Island to do sightseeing. The next day, we were lucky we could observe on the same property where we were staying. Came out with a picnic lunch, and our solar eclipse glasses, and sat at some outdoor tables.\nDuring the actual eclipse, some cloud cover prevented seeing some of the typical phenomena with the shadows of the different phases of the eclipse event, but not the most important color and light shifting parts during totality! The human eye is so weird, because when I look at the video footage I recorded, it doesn’t seem to capture anywhere as much of the experience as I remember. The lighting is all wrong. \nGoing home to Charlotte was a long and mostly uneventful drive, which was the original plan. While inside the vehicle, about half the car attempts to do their remote job using mobile data and headphones. We all took turns driving in silence while people struggled with having limited zoom meetings due to the lower data bandwidth available outside of the bigger cities.\nWe stopped at a coffee shop so someone could take a meeting and get some time out of the car. It happened to be near the Mothman museum in Point Pleasant, WV. We had to take the detour and take pictures of the Mothman statue, and the nearby mural.\nOverall, it was a really fun and interesting trip. I was glad I got to share an experience of natural phenomena with people I care about. The next eclipse is in 2026, and that’s all I’ll say for now until I get more plans solidified. \nIntroducing Betty the dog🔗\nI would not have predicted that this year I was going to be introducing someone new to the family. But we have a new dog, Betty. \nAt the beginning of the year, I was still getting used to a rhythm of life that didn’t include a dog. Around the time of the eclipse, it was already a full year since we said goodbye to Fig in 2022. There is so much story here that I hope to tell some day. \nDespite my persisting feelings about Fig, I was still compelled to know more about Betty after learning about her tough life. My impulse was inspired by Fig’s memory. I understand how time is too short to not trust my instincts, and go with the flow of life and we are entering a new season.\nI want to keep the rest of the story brief, but I hope to tell it in more detail some time in the future.\nAfter filling out the adoption papers, and a long car ride, we arrive at home with Betty in the backseat. We knew she was a bit apprehensive, bc who wouldn’t be? While her harness was getting adjusted, she took her opportunity to take off with her leash dragging behind her. And as quickly as we got her out of the car, she was completely out of sight as she rounded the corner after making it to the other end of the street. \nWe were fortunate when we asked for help from friends and family. The foster family also helped despite being more than an hour away. We canvassed online forums, made bright signs, and searched the area on foot at midnight.\nAfter 10 sleepless nights, we got lucky, and Betty was found in one of her hiding places. We were reunited. She was very malnourished and dehydrated. The worst of her injury was caused by a large cut from friction against the harness, but safe.\nShe was stabilized at the emergency vet, and a few days later we got to retry introducing her to her new home. The upcoming weeks we were able to gain Betty’s trust, find out what she likes to eat and put weight back on her. She healed up quickly! So resilient. After a few weeks, her staples were removed and she got introduced to her neighborhood through daily walks.\nAs I write, about 6 months have gone by, and my life is a little familiar. It is nice to have the routine of dog care. But at the same time very different, since Betty has a strong personality unlike Fig’s strong personality. It is a delight to see Betty come out of her shell. Looking forward to this next chapter of life.\nWhat’s next in 2025?🔗\nI like to believe that even though I am grumpy, it is because I am an optimist. I will make next year work out for me in the end. Creating more than I consume is the goal.\nI’m continuing to document more of my life. I want to improve my storytelling skills by branching out into other forms of media, like video production and video games. I’m set on developing a lot of solo business skills as my alternative to return to tech. I won’t let another opportunistic startup divert my attention.\nI’m thankful for my partner, who has been my safety net. She made sure I had recovery time after my layoff, and has encouraged me to take some time before committing seriously to my next thing. We are fortunate to have savings so there is plenty of room to breathe.\nI’d like to keep these posts coming, but I’m not going to commit to that. I’ll post when it feels right.\n","description":"A look back at highlights of the past year","id":"https://tjtelan.com/blog/year-in-review-2024/","path":"/blog/year-in-review-2024/","title":"2024 Year in Review"},"https://tjtelan.com/blog/zsh-at-win-7-start-up/":{"body":"Beginning of the quarter is tomorrow, and I'm trying to accept that I will be spending more time on a Windows workstation to access the software I'm using for my senior project (more on that soon).\nThere are a few comforts that I am still missing in Win7 that I'm trying to solve with Cygwin, like Improving Cygwin in Windows with Rxvt getting zsh back.\nToday, that issue was being able to write Zsh scripts that would run at login through Cygwin instead of using cmd.exe.\nTurned out to not be quite as straightforward as I had hoped, but still easy.\nAdd Cygwin to Win7 PATH environment variable.🔗\nIt took me a moment to find this information after having trouble using ls in my script.
